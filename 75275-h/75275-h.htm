<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>E left Liz weeping over the
dead body of her father.
How paltry all other troubles
seemed to be, as she did so. She
had no power, at that moment, to
realise any fact but one,—that he had
left her, and without a warning. He,
who had been her sole protector and
companion, beside whom she had walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
every moment of her life, sharing his
knowledge, and his duties, and his cares,
had gone forth into the dreamland without
her, and for the future she must
struggle through life as best she might,
alone. Liz was not ignorant of the
cause of her father’s death, but she
had been quite unprepared for it. She
had known for some time past that
he had a weak heart, but men lived
with such, sometimes to their three
score years and ten. He had passed
a tranquil and unexciting life. The
passions which had raged stormily perhaps
in his youth had forsaken him
in his latter days, and he had appeared
likely to live on to a good old age.
But the events of the last week had
greatly upset him. Liz had no doubt,
as she looked at his pale, calm features,
that his sudden death lay, in a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
measure, at Maraquita’s door, and the
fact did not make her feel more
tenderly towards her adopted sister.
But the infant was wailing in her arms,
and she felt that something must be
done at once. This was no time for
weeping, or inaction. She turned on
her heel, with set features, and teeth
closely clenched together, and passed
into the outer room to summon her
negress attendant Chloe to her aid.
Chloe was conspicuous only by her
absence, but on the threshold of the
outer door she found the yellow girl,
Rosa, slowly rocking herself to and
fro.</p>

<p>‘What are you doing here?’ demanded
Lizzie sternly. ‘Have you not
brought me into enough trouble already?’</p>

<p>The girl turned round and caught
the folds of her dress, and buried her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
face in them, crying. The coloured
people are very emotional, and a sudden
remorse had stabbed the depths of
poor Rosa’s heart.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Lizzie,’ she sobbed, ‘I’se
so sorry the poor Doctor dead! Massa
Courcelles tell me so as he went out.
The dear good Doctor, who was so
berry kind to me in my sickness, and
so good to my little Carlo, and now
he gone too, and me nebber see him
any more, and my heart is broke, Miss
Liz, my heart is broke!’</p>

<p>This tribute to her dead father’s
virtues affected Liz more than anything
else could have done.</p>

<p>‘If <i>you</i> are so sorry for his loss,
Rosa,’ she answered gently, ‘what do
you suppose <i>I</i> must feel. I seem to
have lost everything to-day—<i>everything</i>,’
she added, in a vague and weary tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>‘Oh, Missy Liz, I’se so sorry!’ repeated
Rosa. ‘But what can I do to
help you, and to take some of dis
trouble off you? Let me do something,
Missy Liz, to show I’se real
sorry.’</p>

<p>‘You can go up to the White House,
Rosa, and tell Mr Courtney of—of—<i>this</i>,
and say I should like to see him as soon
as he can come to me. I can’t find Chloe
anywhere.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! dat Chloe no good. She too
stupid!’ cried Rosa, with all a negress’s
jealousy. ‘And may I come back, too,
Missy Liz, with Massa Courtney, and
help you nurse the baby, same as you
helped me with little Carlo?’</p>

<p>The allusion to the child brought
the trouble it had caused her too vividly
to Lizzie’s mind. She dropped into a
chair, and burst into tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>‘Oh, Rosa! Rosa! you have spoiled
my life for me. How could you be so
cruel?’</p>

<p>The yellow girl crawled on her knees
to the side of the Doctor’s daughter.</p>

<p>‘Missy Liz, what I done so bad?
Isn’t dat baby your own baby, then?’</p>

<p>‘Of course it isn’t! How could you
think such a thing of me? It is a
little nurse-child which was left in
charge of my dear father, and I was
minding it for him. But you made
Monsieur de Courcelles believe that it
belongs to me, and you have parted
us for ever. He was to have been my
husband, Rosa, but he never will be so
now; never—never!’</p>

<p>Rosa’s eyes opened with surprise.</p>

<p>‘Missy Liz, you must tell him I’se a
liar. I know noting of de baby, only I
see it on your bed, and I’se so sorry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
I speak to Massa Courcelles about it. It
was de debbil spoke, Missy Liz, and not
me. Something seem to come in my
head and say dat chile like my little
Carlo, and you no better den me. But I
see now I’se all wrong, and you too good
to do such a drefful thing. You tell
Massa Courcelles I’se a liar, and it’ll be
all right again, Missy Liz.’</p>

<p>‘No, Rosa, it will never be right again
in the way you mean. I <i>did</i> tell Monsieur
de Courcelles what you say, but he
refused to believe me. No one will believe
me now, I am afraid,’ said Liz
mournfully, ‘and I must bear the brunt
of my own rash promise.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! Missy Liz, must you keep dat
baby dat isn’t yours, and take de trouble
of it all your life?’</p>

<p>‘I think so, Rosa. I have nowhere to
send it; and you would not have me turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
it out on the cold world alone? No, my
dear dead father left it to me as a sacred
charge,’ cried Lizzie, weeping, ‘and I
will guard it, whatever it may cost me.
It will be something to do for his sake.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss Lizzie!’ exclaimed Rosa,
awed by a display of heroism she could
not understand, ‘you berry good woman!
I nebber know till dis day how good a
woman you are. Let me stay with you,
Miss Lizzie. Send dat Chloe back to
huts, and let me be your servant, ’stead
of her. Chloe don’t know nuffin of
children. <i>She</i> not had a little boy, like
me. Let me nurse dat baby for you,
and I will be faithful, trust me, Missy Liz,
and nebber let de debbil speak through
my mouth again.’</p>

<p>‘I believe you, Rosa,’ replied Lizzie.
‘I believe you are sorry for the mischief
you have done, and that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
would undo it if you could. You were
a good mother to little Carlo, and you
would be a kind nurse to this poor
little one. If it can be managed, it
shall be arranged so, but we can do
nothing without the leave of Mr
Courtney. Go now and tell him of
the grief I am in, and we will talk
of these things another day.’</p>

<p>‘But I will come back and hold de
baby for you, Missy Liz!’ exclaimed
the yellow girl, as she set off towards
the White House.</p>

<p>Liz walked back into the death
chamber, and mechanically performed the
necessary offices to prepare her father’s
body for the grave. She did not weep
again as she did so. The blow of her
two great losses, coming so quickly one
upon the other, had stunned her, and
dried up the sources of her tears. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
would have time to think and weep, she
thought, by-and-by. When Mr Courtney
arrived post-haste in answer to her summons,
his grief appeared to be scarcely
less than her own. He had been sincerely
and deeply attached to this erring
friend of his youthful days, and had
never anticipated losing him so soon.
He shed tears freely over the silent
corpse, and kept on assuring Lizzie that
her future should be one of his first
cares.</p>

<p>‘Don’t let that trouble you, my dear,’
he reiterated. ‘I looked upon your dear
father as my brother, and you shall
never miss his protection whilst I can
extend it to you. From this moment,
Lizzie, I shall regard you as my
daughter, and as soon as the sad ceremonies
which we must go through, are
concluded, I shall carry you off to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
White House, and consider you second
only in my affection to Maraquita.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Mr Courtney, you are too good
to me,’ gasped Lizzie, ‘but—but—please
don’t speak of my future to me to-day.’</p>

<p>‘No, no, of course not. It was
thoughtless of me,’ said the planter; ‘but
I did it with the view to set your mind
at ease. To-day we must give up entirely
to thoughts of my dear and valued
friend.’</p>

<p>He imagined that the girl’s mind was
too distracted to dwell on anything but
her great loss; but Lizzie had remembered
that before the morrow, the
scandal that was being spread abroad
concerning her would reach his ears,
and render her unfit in his eyes to be
the companion of his daughter.</p>

<p>When he had told her what arrangements
he had made for the funeral,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
which (according to the custom in hot
climates) was to take place that evening,
Mr Courtney, with a farewell grasp
of his dead friend’s hand, turned to leave
the bungalow, when his eye fell upon
the yellow girl, Rosa, squatting on the
floor with the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>‘What infant is that?’ he demanded
indifferently, for it was so wrapped up
in flannel that he could not see its
face.</p>

<p>Liz had anticipated the question, and
dreaded it; but she felt evasion would
be useless, and had not attempted to
send the child out of his sight.</p>

<p>‘It is a little girl which was confided
to my dear father’s care,’ she answered,
in a low voice. ‘And he was going to
consult Dr Martin at the Fort about a
nurse to take the charge of it, when he
was called away.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Mr Courtney’s eyes opened somewhat
at her explanation.</p>

<p>‘Is it a white child then?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it is a white child,’ replied Lizzie,
with a deep sigh, as she stood trembling
at what might follow. But Mr Courtney
said no more on the subject. Perhaps
his mind was too full of his lost friend
to think of minor things, anyway he left
the bungalow without another word or
look, and Lizzie breathed more freely
when he had gone. She spent the remainder
of the day beside the remains
of the father whom she had loved so
well, and when the sun had sunk in the
west, and the cool sea breezes commenced
to blow over San Diego, she
followed his coffin to the little European
burial ground, which was situated on the
top of a hill, and in full view of the
glorious ocean. She saw that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
were many friends, both white and
coloured, gathered round the open grave
but she was in no fit condition to recognise
who they were. Only, as the last
words of the solemn service were concluded,
and she heard the sods of earth
rattle on the coffin lid, and felt as if she
must throw herself in with them, and
be buried with all she loved best in
this world, she found some one supporting
her failing steps on either side,
and looking up saw she was standing
between Mr Courtney and Captain
Norris.</p>

<p>‘Come, my dear child,’ whispered the
former. ‘It is all over now. Let us
see you safely to your home.’</p>

<p>They led her between them back to
the empty bungalow, and the three
friends sat down together in the sitting-room,
whilst Rosa squatted in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
verandah with Maraquita’s baby in her
arms. Liz, making an effort to battle
with her emotion, busied herself with
setting some light refreshment before
her guests. Mr Courtney drank a
glass of iced sherbet in silence, and
then cleared his throat as though to
force himself to speak.</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, my dear, I have a good
deal to say to you, and I wish to
say it now. I might leave it till to-morrow,
but I think it will do you
good to fix your mind at once upon
business, and to settle what you are to
do in the future.’</p>

<p>Lizzie turned a little paler than she
had been. She had understood her
future to be settled that morning. But
she guessed why it required further explanation
now.</p>

<p>‘Captain Norris, than whom I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
your dear father had no warmer friend,
has been talking to me on the subject
this afternoon, and has consented to
become the guardian and trustee of your
interests.’</p>

<p>‘I am of age,’ interrupted Lizzie, with
open eyes; ‘I require no guardian.’</p>

<p>‘Stop, my dear, and let me finish what
I have to say. You may not require a
personal guardian, but your monetary interests
may need looking after. I am not
likely to forget you at my death, Lizzie.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, Mr Courtney, you are too
good to me,’ said Liz,—‘as you were to
my poor father,’ she added, in a lower
voice.</p>

<p>‘Your father was my dearest friend: I
can never forget that,’ replied the planter;
‘and I am only following the dictates of
my affection for him in making a suitable
provision for his daughter. I have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
thinking the matter over deeply, Lizzie,
and I have decided that I cannot spare
you from amongst my coolies. Why
should you not carry on the work from
which your father has been so suddenly
called away? I know you are competent
to do so, from what he himself has told
me, and in any difficult cases you can
always call in the assistance of the Doctor
from the Fort. What I propose is that
you should continue to live in this
bungalow (the furniture and effects of
which I shall make over to you as your
own property), and to work amongst the
coloured people; and I will gladly pay
you the same remuneration as heretofore.
Don’t you think it will be the best plan,
Lizzie, and that you will be happier if
you bravely try to forget your grief, in
carrying on a life of activity and usefulness?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>‘I am <i>sure</i> it will be best,’ she answered,
in a low tone.</p>

<p>Her pride, which had made her divine
at once the cause of her benefactor’s change
of mind, would have also prompted her
to refuse his offers of assistance, but she
was helpless in the matter. She had no
friends to go to, no resources to fall back
upon. What could she have done, left
alone in San Diego, but live on charity,
which she would rather have died than
accept? Mr Courtney’s proposal was at
least not a humiliating one. He offered
her money in return for her labour, and
she was resolved to earn it, and thanked
Heaven she was capable of doing so.
That he should not even have alluded
to his promise of the morning wounded
but did not surprise her. He had heard
the wretched slander, which was doubtless
already going the round of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
plantation, concerning her. Henri de
Courcelles had, perhaps, repeated it, and
Mr Courtney already regretted that he
had held out hopes he could not fulfil.
Well, he should not read her disappointment
in her eyes. She would put a
brave face on the matter, and battle (as
best she could) for herself; for the oath
she had taken to her dead father was
doubly sacred, now that all hope of release
from it was over.</p>

<p>‘We will do all in our power to make
your life comfortable,’ continued Mr Courtney;
‘and you may always depend on me,
Lizzie, as your friend.’</p>

<p>He did not include his wife’s and
daughter’s friendship with his own, and
Lizzie noticed the omission, and shrunk
under it.</p>

<p>‘Mr Courtney,’ she said, in a firm
voice, though her eyes were full of tears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
‘I thank you for your offers of assistance,
and I accept them gratefully. I did not
know till a few days back, the whole
extent to which my poor father was indebted
to you, but I shall never forget it,
and if I can ever repay it in the slightest
degree, I will.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, my dear! It was nothing.
Don’t speak of it now.’</p>

<p>‘It was his <i>life</i>, Mr Courtney, and I
should not be his daughter were I unmindful
of it. I should have liked to
relieve you of the burden, now <i>he</i> is gone,
but I don’t know what I could do, without
friends, and in a foreign country. So
I will remain on (as you are good enough
to propose), and work among your plantation
hands, and do all I possibly can to
return your kindness to us both.’</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, my dear, I don’t wish you to
think of it as if it were a favour. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
obligation is quite as much on my side.
And you mustn’t speak of yourself as
friendless, either, my dear. You have
friends on all sides, I am sure of that.
You know what <i>I</i> feel towards you; and
here is Captain Norris, grieving only
second to myself for your loss; and every one
in San Diego loves and respects
you. You may take my word for that,
Lizzie.’</p>

<p>Mr Courtney had risen, as if to take his
departure, whilst he spoke, and now stood
in the doorway, with his straw hat in his
hand, and beckoned her towards him.</p>

<p>‘By the way,’ he added, in a lower
tone, ‘what do you intend to do about
that child, Lizzie?’ jerking his head towards
Rosa and the baby.</p>

<p>‘What should I do about it?’ she returned.
‘I know no place to send it to.
It was in the charge of Mammy Lila, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
she died of the fever. I suppose I must
keep it here.’</p>

<p>‘Where are its parents?’ demanded the
planter inquisitively.</p>

<p>‘It has none, Mr Courtney, or none
who will own it.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me! That is very strange, and
very awkward. Who confided it to your
father’s care?’</p>

<p>‘I am not at liberty to tell you, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know then?’</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and then
answered, in a husky tone,—</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘And you will not tell me, Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘I am bound under a solemn oath, Mr
Courtney, not to reveal anything about
that child, and I must beg of you not to
question me.’</p>

<p>‘It looks bad for you, my dear, and may
be the cause of a great deal of future<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
unhappiness. There are not so many
Europeans on the island that such an
event can occur without comment; and if
you persist in holding your tongue on the
subject, people <i>will</i> talk about it, and to
your disadvantage.’</p>

<p>‘Then they <i>must</i> talk, Mr Courtney,’
replied Lizzie boldly, though she had
turned very pale. ‘I cannot break my
promise to my father, for any consideration,
not even to save my reputation.’</p>

<p>‘Lizzie,’ whispered the planter presently,
‘promise me at least to send the
child away. Let <i>me</i> send it away for you.
You don’t know <i>what</i> people are saying
about you. Even De Courcelles has heard
the rumour, and came to me for an explanation
of it. I will ask you no questions,
my dear, but let me help you in the
matter by sending the infant to one of the
sister islands. I cannot bear to think that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
any one should dare to say a word against
you, for your father’s sake.’</p>

<p>‘You are very kind, Mr Courtney, but I
have made up my mind on this subject,
and the child will remain with me. Sending
her away now to the care of a hireling,
will not remove the stain her presence
here has cast upon my character; and I
have reasons for wishing to bring her up
myself. If you object to it, I will relieve
you of the burden of both of us; but that
infant is my father’s last charge to me, and
I will keep it.’</p>

<p>‘If you would only trust <i>me</i> with the
secret of its birth, I could fight your battle
with you,’ said Mr Courtney sadly.</p>

<p>‘I will trust no one, sir. I have lost all
that I cared for in this world, through its
means, and I will at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that I have remained
true to myself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>‘Very well, my dear; good-night; and
remember I am still your friend,’ replied
the planter, as he walked slowly away.</p>

<p>Lizzie looked after him for a moment,
and then returning to the apartment, and
regardless of the presence of Hugh Norris,
she flung herself into a chair, and burst
into a flood of tears.</p>

<p>‘<i>Still my friend!</i>’ she repeated. ‘Yes,
but a friend without any trust or confidence
left in me. Ah! what is the use of his
assurances? I can read his heart too
well! I have not a friend left in the
world.’</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>S she said the words, Captain
Norris sprang towards her.</p>

<p>‘<i>Not a friend left in the
world</i>, Liz! Oh! how can you say
such a cruel thing whilst I am here?’</p>

<p>She could not answer him immediately
for weeping, but she stretched
forth her hand and laid it on his arm.</p>

<p>‘Forgive me, Captain Norris. I know
that you are my friend, but grief makes
us all selfish. Yet that they should think
such a thing of me,—that even Mr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Courtney, who has known me from a
little child, should suspect me of so unworthy
an action, it is bitterly, <i>bitterly</i>
hard.’</p>

<p>‘You are speaking in riddles to me,
Lizzie! Of <i>what</i> do they suspect you?
Surely of nothing of which you need be
ashamed? If so, they must answer to
<i>me</i> for it. Your dead father honoured
me with his friendship, and no one shall
insult his daughter whilst I am able to
prevent it.’</p>

<p>‘I should have known that I might
count upon your championship, Captain
Norris; but it is useless. I have entangled
myself in a net from which I
see no prospect of freedom. You must
leave me to bear the consequences by
myself.’</p>

<p>‘I shall do no such thing!’ replied the
Captain warmly. ‘What is the worth of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
friendship if it cannot stand by you in
the time of need? Confide in me, Lizzie.
Tell me your trouble, and let us devise
a way out of it together.’</p>

<p>‘We cannot do that,’ replied Lizzie
mournfully; ‘but you shall hear it, all the
same. If I did not tell you, San Diego
would soon do so. All the hands are
talking of it by this time. Even that
yellow girl in the verandah is ready to
believe me to have fallen to a level
with herself.’</p>

<p>‘You alarm me!’ exclaimed Hugh
Norris. ‘What is it they dare to say
of you?’</p>

<p>‘That that child is mine!’</p>

<p>‘<i>What</i> child? I did not know there
was a child here.’</p>

<p>‘You are the last to hear of it then,’
replied Lizzie bitterly. ‘The smallest
lad on the plantation has discussed it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
before now. I mean the infant which
Rosa has in her arms. It is <i>not</i> mine!
I hope you will believe me when I say
so. But I have no means of proving
the truth of what I say.’</p>

<p>‘You surprise me beyond measure,’
said Captain Norris. ‘In what does the
difficulty lie, and why cannot you appeal
to the real parents to help you out of it?’</p>

<p>‘Captain Norris, you must not question
me too closely, lest I should betray a secret
I have sworn to keep. Be satisfied with
what I tell you. It was only yesterday
my father gave me that child to nurse
for him. He asked me to keep it through
the night, and in the morning he would
get a proper person to take charge of
it. You have heard the sequel. By
the morning, God had called him away,
and I am left with this burden on my
hands for ever!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>‘But, Lizzie, forgive me if I do not
follow you. What reason is there for
your keeping the child? What interest
had your father in it? Why should you
not send it to the people he intended to
entrust it to?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I might have done so if this
suspicion had not fallen upon me; but
<i>now</i>, what would be the use of it? Absent
or present, the child will be regarded as
mine. I shall have to bear the stigma;
I may as well have the satisfaction of
knowing I have fulfilled my dead father’s
wishes.’</p>

<p>‘Do you know who are the parents of
the child?’</p>

<p>Lizzie was silent.</p>

<p>‘I see that you do. Surely they will
never permit you innocently to bear this
awful shame?’</p>

<p>‘Captain Norris, when my father first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
showed me that child, he extracted a
solemn oath from me never to reveal
anything I knew or might guess concerning
it. It is useless your questioning
me. My tongue is tied, and whatever
my silence may cost me, I am bound to
endure.’</p>

<p>‘But surely your lover, De Courcelles,
does not believe this slanderous lie about
you, Lizzie? <i>He</i> will stand up in your
defence, whatever the world may say, and
fight it with you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t talk of him! Don’t mention
his name!’ cried Lizzie, with a sudden
burst of grief. ‘He <i>does</i> believe it,
Captain Norris, and he has cast me off.
We are parted for ever. Our engagement
is at an end.’</p>

<p>‘The cur!’ exclaimed Norris contemptuously.</p>

<p>‘You shall not call him so! What else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
could he do?’ rejoined Lizzie hastily.
‘What would <i>you</i> do, if the woman you
had engaged yourself to marry, proved
to be a wanton? You would say she
was not fit to be your wife, and you
would be right. Until this stigma is
lifted off me, I am not fit to become the
wife of any honest man.’</p>

<p>‘But it does not rest upon you, in <i>my</i>
estimation,’ replied her companion. ‘I do
not believe it; no one should ever make
me do so except yourself. I would take
your word against that of a thousand
witnesses, Lizzie.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, thank you!’ she exclaimed,
reddening with pleasure at the sound of
his honest voice. ‘You are indeed a
friend in the time of need. But Monsieur
de Courcelles thinks otherwise. He
has told me to my face that unless I will
divulge the names of the parents of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
child, everything between us must be at
an end. And so it is at an end. I cannot
break my word to the dead. Besides—there
are other reasons why I should
be true to my trust.’</p>

<p>‘You will at least tell me one thing,
Lizzie. You know to whom this child
belongs, do you not? I ask it in your
own interests.’</p>

<p>‘I do.’</p>

<p>‘Then go to them, my dear, and tell
them the dilemma in which the promise
you have given on their account has
placed you. Ask them to release you
from it. Surely no one could be so
inhuman as to desire their shame (for
I presume shame is at the bottom of
this mystery) to spoil the life of an
innocent woman? Oh! if I only knew
their names myself, I would proclaim
them far and wide, until I forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
them to release you from this cruel
bondage.’</p>

<p>‘It is <i>impossible</i>, Captain Norris!’</p>

<p>‘Impossible for you to go to them?’</p>

<p>‘Impossible that my going could do
any good in the matter. I cannot rid
myself of the blame, without shifting it
on the shoulders of another, and that
my oath forbids me to do. Pray leave
me, Captain Norris. Leave me to bear
it as best I may—<i>alone</i>! You heard
what Mr Courtney has kindly proposed,—that
I shall live on here, and continue
my dear father’s work. I mean to do
so, and if God spares the child, it shall
live with me. The coloured people will
not despise us. They have too many
of such cases amongst themselves, and
for the rest, I am strong enough to suffer
without sinking under it.’</p>

<p>‘But not <i>alone</i>, dear Lizzie!’ exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Hugh Norris, taking her hand. ‘If your
engagement to Monsieur de Courcelles
is indeed broken off, let me speak again.
You would not listen to me last week
on <i>his</i> account; listen to me now on your
own. Come to me, and let me fight the
battle of life for all three of us—you
and me and the child. If it were <i>really</i>
your child, Lizzie, I should say the same.
When I told you I loved you, I did not
mean that I loved some ideal creature
raised from my own imagination, but <i>you</i>—yourself,
with all your faults (if you
have faults) and follies (which cannot be
greater than my own), and am willing
to condone everything, for the privilege
of loving you. Let me try to make you
forget this sorrow. In England, amidst
new scenes and new friends, you may
learn to feel differently, even towards
me, and look back on San Diego as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
bad dream, that has passed away for
ever.’</p>

<p>Lizzie pressed his hand gratefully.</p>

<p>‘How good you are to me,’ she answered,
‘and how true! I am sure you
will make the best and most loving of
husbands, and some woman will be very
happy with you. But that woman will
not be <i>me</i>! I would not wrong you, my
dear friend, by accepting your generous
proposal. Why should I cast this
shadow over your honourable life, or
profess to offer you a heart not worthy of
your acceptance? I love Henri de Courcelles!
Ah! don’t shrink from me. I
know he is unworthy and unjust, nor
can I believe he has ever really cared
for me; but he managed to win my
love, and I cannot take it back from
him so suddenly. By-and-by, perhaps,
when this wound is somewhat healed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
and time has enabled me to see more
clearly, I shall be strong enough to
shake off the fascination that enthralls
me; but just now, I can only weep
over its decay, as I weep over the grave
of my lost father. And so you see
how utterly unworthy I am of the noble
offer you have made me.’</p>

<p>‘Not in <i>my</i> eyes,’ persisted Hugh
Norris. ‘I can never think of you but
as the dearest and most self-sacrificing
of women, and I shall keep the place
in my heart open for you to my life’s
end. But I will worry you no further
now. Only say if I can do anything for
you, Lizzie, before I go.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing,’ she sighed. ‘Unless it be
to come to see me again, and comfort
me as you have done to-day.’</p>

<p>His face brightened with pleasure at her
proposal, and he acceded to it joyfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>‘I will come up to-morrow if it will
not be too soon,’ he answered. ‘I have
not landed my coolies yet, and the
<i>Trevelyan</i> may be in port for some
weeks yet.’</p>

<p>‘How is that?’ demanded Lizzie.</p>

<p>‘On account of this fever, and also of
the town riots. My consignee is afraid
of both moral and physical infection.
There was an attack planned on Government
House last night, and only just
discovered in time. The rebels had laid
a train of gunpowder right under the
state rooms. There would have been
a fearful sacrifice of life had they succeeded.’</p>

<p>‘How terrible! Were they caught?’</p>

<p>‘Unfortunately they were not, for they
got off to the Alligator Swamp as soon
as the alarm was given. And no one
dares follow them there: the danger is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
too great. They are watching outside
it, however, and as soon as they come
out, they will be killed or arrested.’</p>

<p>‘Poor creatures,’ said Liz, with a
shudder, ‘they will not be able to hold
out long. Twelve hours in the Alligator
Swamp is said to be certain death. Its
poisonous atmosphere kills all those who
escape the alligators. It is too fearful to
think of.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I fancy the poor devils will be
forced to surrender, and they will get
no quarter from the Governor, Sir
Russell Johnstone. He is in a great
state of alarm about himself, and resolved
to stamp the insurrection out at
any cost.’</p>

<p>‘One cannot blame him. It is a case
in which the few must suffer for the
many. Is the Governor a nice man,
Captain Norris?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>‘So-so. A very ordinary-looking
Englishman,—more fit to till his own
acres, I should imagine, than to govern
a colony. He has certainly done little
as yet to quell the ill-feeling in San
Diego, which seems to be increasing
every day. But I shall not be able to
keep my coolies on board much longer.
There are six hundred of them, and I
shall not be sorry when their backs are
turned. I have had enough of their
company on the way from Calcutta.’</p>

<p>‘But they will make a bad exchange,
I expect, from the hold of the <i>Trevelyan</i>
to the cotton and sugar plantations. I
have heard poor father say you spoil
your coolies, Captain Norris, and make
them quite dissatisfied with their reception
in the West Indies.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s a libel!’ cried the young
man, smiling. ‘I may have tried to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
their life aboard ship as little irksome
as possible, but it has gone no further.
But I am afraid they are mostly shipped
under false pretences, and led to expect
less work and more pay than they
are ever likely to get in these islands.
Their existence, at the best, is hardly
worth living.’</p>

<p>‘You are right there, and no one
who has dwelt amongst them, as I have,
could fail to sympathise with their
troubles. They have much to bear,
and little to compensate them for it.
And with all their faults, they are a
patient people, although very impulsive.
That poor girl in the verandah did me
a bad turn this morning, but she is
ready to break her heart about it now.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Missy Liz, I’se <i>so</i> sorry!’ cried
Rosa, who had overheard the words
that concerned herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>‘But you can’t undo the mischief, you
see, Rosa, so try and make up for it by
being a faithful servant to your mistress
now,’ said Hugh Norris, as he passed
over the threshold on his way home.</p>

<p>The yellow girl did not take correction
from a stranger very well. She
shrugged her shoulders, and pulled a
face after the retreating form of Captain
Norris, as she entered the bungalow with
her infant charge.</p>

<p>‘What business of that Massa Norris
to speak me?’ she inquired, pouting.
‘If he want to scold some one, he’d
better go and find dat coolie girl Judy,
what took the baby first. She’s a berry
bad girl—rude and impident—with a
tongue as long as an alligator’s.’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean Mammy Lila’s granddaughter?’
inquired Lizzie. ‘When did
you see her, Rosa?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>‘Oh! she’s big enough to be seen,
Missy Liz, and she’s just as cunning
as they’re made. Judy has left Shanty
Hill now, and come to live alongside of
her own people, and dis morning Massa
Courcelles has given her work on the
plantation. And dat gal’s tongue—how
it <i>do</i> run!’</p>

<p>‘About <i>me</i>, I suppose?’ said Liz
bitterly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Missy Liz—that’s just it—about
you. Judy tells every one how you went
up to Shanty Hill in the middle of the
night wid dis poor little baby in your
arms, and how you was so ill and weak
you nearly tumbled down on de floor;
and Mammy Lila took de baby, and you
tell her, “<i>Silence and secrecy</i>,” which
means, “Don’t tell nuffin to nobody on
your life.”’</p>

<p>‘And every one believes it was my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
own baby I took to Mammy Lila, Rosa,
the same as you did?’</p>

<p>‘What <i>can</i> they believe, Missy Liz?
I didn’t know what to believe myself.
Dere’s not too many quite white babies
knocking about de island, you know, and
dis little one has no coloured blood in
it. Dat’s plain to be seen. And dat
Judy is so impident. She’d say anything.
She says she skeered you so
when she brought the baby back agin
when Mammy Lila died, dat you nearly
fainted, and it was de shock and de
trouble that has killed de poor Doctor
right away.’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, Rosa, don’t speak of it
any more at present. It turns my heart
sick to hear it. Take the infant into
my room, and put it to bed. Judy’s
talk, however untrue, can do me no
further harm; and you mustn’t forget,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
whilst judging her, that you thought and
said pretty much the same yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, yes, Missy Liz; but den I’se
berry sorry, and I’ll be a good gal to
you now,’ replied Rosa, with the nigger’s
ready excuse for anything they may have
done wrong.</p>

<p>‘And I believe you, so let the matter
rest,’ said Lizzie, as the yellow girl disappeared
with the baby, and she sat
down at the table, resting her head upon
her hand.</p>

<p>What a difference twenty-four hours
had made in her life! Twenty-four hours
ago she had possessed a father who loved
her, a lover who respected her, friends
who believed in her, a good name and
a spotless reputation. Now, she seemed
to have lost everything at one fell blow.
Her father was gone, her lover lost, her
friends stood afar off. She was publicly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
spoken of as an unmarried mother, and
Maraquita’s sin was laid at her door.
And she had no means of repudiating
the scandal. Nothing but her bare word
stood between her reputation and the
world. Who would believe her? What
woman would <i>not</i> deny such a crushing
shame?</p>

<p>Her solemn oath to her father, the
fathomless obligation under which they
stood to Mr Courtney, the awful consequences
to their benefactor which must
follow a revelation of the truth, stared
Lizzie in the face, like giant obstacles
that forbid her even attempting to surmount
them. What would she and her
dead father have been but for the generosity
extended to them through life by
the planter’s hand?</p>

<p>He, a felon and a convict, and <i>she</i>,
the daughter of a disgraced and dishonoured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
man, pointed at by the finger
of scorn, shunned by the community of
the virtuous and honest, a pariah and an
outcast amongst men. No wonder her
father had exacted her silence and obedience
at the price of her salvation.</p>

<p>But would Maraquita be so untrue to
all the instincts of honour and justice as
to permit her adopted sister to continue to
bear the shame which rightly belonged to
herself? Liz remembered Hugh Norris’s
advice to her to seek out the parents of
the child, and beg them to clear her good
name in the eyes of the world. The
counsel was good. She only knew of
Quita as the mother of the infant; but
she could, at all events, secure an interview
with her, and implore her to confess
the truth to Mr and Mrs Courtney, and
relieve her from so intolerable a burthen.
Surely, thought Lizzie, if Quita knew what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
she was suffering—and likely to suffer—she
could not have the heart to refuse
her! Little Quita, whom she had held
in her arms as a baby herself—who had
learned to walk clinging to her hand—who
had shared her girlish pleasures and
sorrows with her, and told her all her
secrets (except this last terrible one)—surely
<i>Quita</i> would never blast her whole
future in order to shield herself from the
consequences of her sin!</p>

<p>Perhaps she did not know about Henri
de Courcelles! Liz had loved this man
too deeply to talk upon the subject;
and as the engagement had never been
publicly ratified, Quita might not be
aware of the cruel separation her guilt
had caused between them. If she knew
<i>that</i>—if she were told that some one
whom Liz loved as fondly as ever <i>she</i>
could have loved the father of her child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
must be given up for ever, unless she
spoke out—surely she would muster up
courage to remove the heavy load she
had laid upon her childhood’s friend.</p>

<p>As Lizzie arrived at this conclusion,
she lifted up her head and breathed more
freely. A light was breaking through her
darkness. Perhaps, after all, she had condemned
her adopted sister too hastily, and
should have waited to see her before she
passed judgment. The time had been too
short, and events had been too hurried, to
enable Maraquita to do her justice. Perhaps
she was even ignorant of the blame
cast upon her; and with this last charitable
thought of her adopted sister, and a resolution
to see her on the first opportunity,
Lizzie sought her bed, and tried to compose
herself to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>ARAQUITA was lying in her
silken hammock, swinging under
the orange trees, and thinking
over the events of the last few days.
They had been important ones for her.
The unexpected death of the Doctor had
frightened her beyond measure, and more
than ever did she feel that Henri de
Courcelles owed it to her to make every
exertion in his power to remove the
proof of her shame from San Diego.
Until that was done, she should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
no rest. But she was very undecided
about Sir Russell Johnstone. She didn’t
wish to marry him—all her heart (such
as it was) was set on Henri de Courcelles—but
yet she wanted to be the
wife of the Governor of San Diego, and
certain hints from her mother had shown
her it would be the best, and perhaps
the only way, to get out of the scrape
she was in. And if she refused Sir
Russell Johnstone, it would be all the
same; her parents would never consent
to her marrying Monsieur de Courcelles.</p>

<p>Maraquita tossed to and fro as she
thought over these things, and made the
hammock swing as far as its cords
would admit, till the orange blossoms
and their glossy leaves swept across her
face, and old Jessica, who was watching
from below as usual, called out to her
young mistress to take care. Quita was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
trying to argue the matter out with herself
(as silly people will) so as to make
the pieces of the puzzle fit each other
and please everybody all round, being
too blind or too selfish, meanwhile, to
see that the only person she was really
bent on pleasing was herself. She believed
that in a very few days she would
be called upon to decide the matter, for
her mother had received a letter from
the Governor to ask if her daughter had
returned to the White House, but she
was hardly prepared, as she lay there
that morning, to see Sir Russell’s
barouche, with its pair of English
horses, and its outriders, dash up the
drive, and stop before the portals of
her home. She flushed so rosy at the
sight, that Jessica observed her emotion.</p>

<p>‘Dat only de Governor, missy, come
to see Massa Courtney. De Governor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
a fine gennelman, isn’t he, missy? Got
beautiful coat and trousers and waistcoat
on, and fine whiskers, and nice red face.
Dat Government House a beautiful place,
too, and dat carriage lovely. I’d like to
see my missy in a carriage like dat, wid
fine English horses, and coachman, and
all.’</p>

<p>‘What nonsense you are talking, Jessica,’
said Quita querulously, as she
turned her head away. ‘Papa’s carriage
is quite good enough for me, and I
don’t want any other.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but some day my missy marry
fine gennelman, and have everyting dat’s
nice and beautiful. Not one of dese
island fellers—overseers and such like,’
continued the negress contemptuously,
‘with half de blood black in their veins,
but a real English gennelman, with
plenty money, and all white blood.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Maraquita reddened, and yawned, and
turned pettishly away. She knew well
enough to whom old Jessica was alluding,
and she resented the hint as an
impertinence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Russell Johnstone had
rushed into the presence of Mr and Mrs
Courtney.</p>

<p>‘Fancy, my dear sir,’ he was exclaiming,
‘that yesterday the police actually
discovered a train of gunpowder laid
right under the banqueting-room of
Government House! Had it not been
for their vigilance, at the next dinner-party
I gave, we might all have been
blown up—I, you, your wife, even your
lovely daughter. It is too horrible a
catastrophe to contemplate!’</p>

<p>‘Horrible indeed!’ echoed his host.
‘But are you sure that all is now safe?
Has a thorough search been made?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>‘They tell me so, and that I need have
no further alarm. But it has shaken my
nerves, I can tell you that. And the
delinquents are not caught either, though
the native police are on the alert.’</p>

<p>‘How is that?’</p>

<p>‘They have escaped to the Alligator
Swamp; though why they can’t pursue
them there, beats me altogether.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, my dear Sir Russell,’ cried Mr
Courtney, ‘you don’t know what the
Alligator Swamp is like, or you would
not be surprised. Even a negro will not
venture to enter it, unless he is in fear
of his life. It is a regular morass of
green slime. It is impossible to tell at
each step you take whether you will sink
to the bottom of it or not; and it is infested
with alligators or caymen of the
largest and most ferocious breed. No
living creatures but the caymen could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
breathe such an atmosphere; for the
green swamp raises poisonous fungi, the
vapours alone of which are almost certain
death. These wretches who have
plotted against your life cannot possibly
escape punishment. If they do not fall
into the hands of the police, they will
certainly die, the victims of the pestilential
atmosphere of the Alligator
Swamp.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad to hear it,’ replied the
Governor, who was a short, stout man
of ordinary appearance, and with rather
a round and rosy face, ‘for I don’t consider
my appointment worth the risk of
being blown up. The island seems to
me to be in a regular state of rebellion,
and I don’t like it. If any more plots
against my safety are discovered, I shall
resign, and return to England. Her
Majesty would be the last person to wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
me to remain if there is the slightest fear
of danger.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, there must not be—there <i>shall</i> not
be!’ exclaimed Mrs Courtney pathetically,
as the pictures of a retreating Governor
and a lost son-in-law floated before her
mental vision. ‘These wretches must be
brought to judgment, and executed. I
would have them all hanged, if I were
you, Sir Russell. The idea of their
attempting such an outrage! Hanging
would be too good for them.’</p>

<p>‘I am not sure if I <i>can</i> hang them;
but, if so, you may be sure I will,’ rejoined
the Governor. ‘Why, it makes a
man quite nervous of going to his bed.
It’s absurd—ridiculous—an insult to the
British Government!’</p>

<p>‘It must be stamped out at any cost,’
said Mr Courtney; ‘and until it is—until
things are more settled—if you would like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
to vacate Government House for a little
while, and would accept the hospitality
of Beauregard, Sir Russell, why, all I
can say is, that everything I possess
(humble as it may be) is at your service.’</p>

<p>‘But wouldn’t they say I had run
away?’ replied the Governor. ‘I should
like it above all things, but the papers
have been rather spiteful about me of
late, and I am afraid they would declare
I had shown the white feather.’</p>

<p>‘But you must think of your own
safety—<i>that</i> is the first consideration,
surely!’ exclaimed Mrs Courtney. ‘And
you must think of others too, Sir Russell,—of
those who care for you. My poor
Maraquita will be in a fever of anxiety
as soon as she hears this news.’</p>

<p>She had begun to be afraid that
his own peril had somewhat displaced
Maraquita from the Governor’s thoughts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and the idea that he might even be
frightened out of San Diego without
fulfilling his promise, filled her with
alarm. She determined that if possible
the engagement should be ratified at once,
and then, if anything further happened
to frighten Sir Russell back to England,
he would be compelled to take his wife
with him. Her <i>ruse</i> had the desired
effect, and the mention of her daughter
turned the Governor’s thoughts in another
direction.</p>

<p>‘Ah, the beautiful Miss Courtney.
Pray don’t think that I have forgotten
her, in the exercise of my functions.
To quell this native rebellion is the
first duty I owe to my Queen and
country, but my heart has been at the
White House, my dear madam, all
the time. How is your sweet daughter?
Have you told her of my proposal?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Is it possible I may have the great
pleasure of seeing her?’</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney was not quite sure
what to answer. She glanced at her
husband, but he was standing with his
back to her, and would make no sign,
so she was thrown upon her own resources.
Yet she was a woman, and
when it is a matter of <i>finesse</i>, when
do a woman’s resources fail?</p>

<p>‘She is better, dear Sir Russell—much
better, almost well, in fact, but
still weak, and unequal to any exertion.
I <i>did</i> try to approach the subject
of your most flattering proposal to
her on her return home, but her agitation
became so great, I was forced to
relinquish it. You must not condemn
her weakness. The prospect is a very
dazzling one to a simple and innocent
girl like our Maraquita.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>‘Do you mean to tell me, then, that
she is favourably disposed towards me?’
inquired the Governor excitedly.</p>

<p>It is true that he was a Governor,
and would perhaps have been somewhat
surprised at any woman in San Diego
refusing his suit. But at the same time
he was fifty years of age, stout, bald,
and past the age of romance, and it
was enough to make any such man
excited, to hear that a pure and lovely
girl of eighteen was ready and eager
to fly into his arms. He was quite
aware of the value of the position he
had to offer to the planter’s daughter,
but he was conceited enough to be
gulled into the belief that she could
actually fall in love with him, more than
with the advantages which a marriage
with him would entail. His rosy face
became rubicund with expectant pleasure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and he already saw himself with
the most beautiful woman in San Diego
folded in his embrace.</p>

<p>‘<i>Favourably disposed!</i>’ echoed Mrs
Courtney. ‘My dear Sir Russell, that
is not the word! Maraquita is overpowered
by the preference you have
shown towards her, only too shy to offer
you her timid girlish love in return.
She is so afraid she can give you nothing
worth the having in exchange for
your noble proposal to make her your
wife.’</p>

<p>‘If she will give me <i>herself</i>, it is all
I ask,’ returned the Governor. ‘And
now, tell me, may I see her, and plead
my cause in person?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Sir Russell, one moment!’ cried
Mrs Courtney, hurriedly. ‘Let Mr
Courtney offer you some refreshment,
whilst I prepare our sweet girl for your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
visit. You do not know how shy and
sensitive she is. The very mention of
marriage makes her blush. Let me go
to my child, and when she is calm
enough to receive you, I will return and
tell you so.’</p>

<p>‘As you please, my dear madam, but
don’t try my patience too far. Mr
Courtney and I will have a cigar together,
and talk over our plans for the
future, whilst you are gone.’ And with
a courtly bow to his hostess, Sir Russell
let her leave the room.</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney hastened at once to
Maraquita’s side. <i>Hastened</i> is not
exactly the word for the ungraceful
waddle which she used when she wished
to expedite her footsteps, but she walked
as fast as her unwieldy form would
permit her, to the shady spot where
Quita’s hammock swung under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
orange trees, and having dismissed
Jessica to the house, she entered at once
upon her subject.</p>

<p>‘Quita, my darling, Sir Russell Johnstone
has come for your answer to his
proposal.’</p>

<p>She was clever in her own way, this
half-educated, half-bred Spanish woman.
She knew that if she gave Quita time
to reflect, she would probably think of
a way out of the dilemma in which she
found herself, or consult her lover, and
be persuaded perhaps to elope with him,
and ruin her prospects for ever. She
had read enough of her daughter’s mind
on the first day she returned home, to
see that all her inclinations were opposed
to marrying Sir Russell Johnstone,
and if she were persuaded to
consent to it, it must be through <i>finesse</i>,
or an appeal to her ambition. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Mrs Courtney wanted now, was to hurry
Maraquita into accepting the Governor’s
proposal, and make her so far commit
herself that she could not back out of
it afterwards. And she had good materials
to work upon, for Maraquita was
a youthful copy of her mother, as vain,
and selfish, and indolent, and heartless,
and as fond of luxuries and the good
things of this life. But she was considerably
startled at hearing she had to
make up her mind so soon, and her
large dark eyes—so like those of a deer—opened
wide with consternation and
alarm.</p>

<p>‘Oh, mother! Surely I need not give
him an answer to-day. It is so very soon.
I have had no time to think about it.’</p>

<p>‘<i>No time to think about it!</i>’ echoed Mrs
Courtney; ‘why, the case is plain enough.
What thinking does it require? Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Russell offers to make you Lady Johnstone,
and the mistress of Government
House. He has an income of many
thousands a year, and your father will
settle a handsome dowry on you if you
marry him. You will be the richest
woman, and the woman of highest rank,
in San Diego, and every soul in the island
will exclaim at your good fortune. What
more, in the name of Heaven, do you
want, Maraquita?’</p>

<p>‘I am so afraid I sha’n’t love him,’
sighed the girl, with a last remnant of
womanly feeling.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ exclaimed Mrs Courtney,
turning her back upon her daughter, and
professing to be about to leave her, ‘I
will go and tell Sir Russell, and at once!
He is waiting your answer, and I can’t
keep a Governor on tenterhooks for hours.
If you refuse him, he says he is going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
back to England by the next steamer,
and shall never return here, as he is sick
of San Diego, and will only stay on condition
you become his wife. But as you
won’t try to love him, it is of no use.’</p>

<p>‘Stay, mother, stay!’ cried Quita
hurriedly; ‘don’t go just yet. Wait one
moment, and speak to me. Is it <i>really</i>
true that Sir Russell will leave San Diego
if I don’t marry him?’</p>

<p>‘Didn’t I say so, Maraquita. He declares
that nothing shall make him stay; and if
he returns, it will be with a Lady Johnstone
to preside over Government House for
him. He will marry an English girl, and
you will have the mortification of seeing
some woman, with half your beauty, enjoying
all the advantages you have been
fool enough to refuse. Quita, I have no
patience with you.’</p>

<p>‘But, mamma—mamma, I haven’t refused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
him. I don’t <i>mean</i> to refuse him!
If (as you say) I must make up my
mind at once, I <i>have</i> made it up! I
accept Sir Russell’s proposal, and you
can go and tell him so.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, my darling girl!’ exclaimed Mrs
Courtney effusively, ‘I was sure you would
see this grand prospect in its proper light
at last. How proud and delighted your
father will be to hear your decision. But
you must give Sir Russell his answer in
person, my love. You must let me bring
him here, and tell him yourself that you
will be his wife.’</p>

<p>‘But I am not fit to see any one. I am
so untidy!’ cried Quita, jumping out of her
hammock, and standing before her mother.</p>

<p>She was clothed in a long loose robe, of
saffron colour, with hanging sleeves, that
showed her white arms, and a belt that
spanned her slender waist. Her dusky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
hair lay in a rippling mass upon her
shoulders, and her fair face was flushed
with excitement, and perhaps regret. She
had never looked more lovely in her life,
and Mrs Courtney regarded her with
pardonable pride and admiration.</p>

<p>‘You are charming, my dear! I will
not have you wait to make a single alteration
in your dress; and Sir Russell is so
impatient, that he will readily pardon the
negligence of your morning attire. He
knows you have been ill, and are disinclined
for much exertion. Sit down in
this chair, Quita, and I will bring him to
you in another minute. Oh, my dear
child,’ concluded Mrs Courtney, with a
close embrace, ‘how thankful I am that all
is about to end so happily for you! You
have half killed me by your thoughtlessness
and imprudence.’</p>

<p>There were genuine tears in her mother’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
eyes as she pronounced the words, and
Quita felt for the first time, perhaps, what
a terrible risk she had run.</p>

<p>‘Never mind, mamma!’ she whispered,
‘it is over now, and <i>he</i>—he has promised me
that I shall never hear anything more about
it. Let us try and forget it ever occurred.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, my dearest girl, that is just what
you must do. Blot out the past, like a
hideous dream. It has been a terrible
experience for you, and so long as you
remained unmarried, I should always have
trembled for your safety. But now—as
the wife of the Governor, my dear child’s
future is assured, and we will never mention
the hateful subject again—not even to
each other.’</p>

<p>‘No! and, mamma, you told me the
other day that (excepting for certain reasons)
you would have had some changes
made on the plantation. Couldn’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
manage to have those changes made now.
Not too suddenly, you know, so as to
excite suspicion, but as if they were
brought about in the natural course of
events. Can’t you persuade papa,’ said
Maraquita, hiding her face in her mother’s
bosom, ‘to engage a—a—new overseer?
It would be better for all of us.’</p>

<p>‘You are quite right, my darling,’
whispered Mrs Courtney back again, ‘and
I am glad you have so much sense.
Trust me, dear, that you shall not be
annoyed in this matter. As soon as your
marriage is settled, I will take you up
on the hill range for change of air, and
before you return we will have done
what you suggest. I have a dozen good
reasons to give your father for engaging
some one else in that person’s place.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be harsh with him,’ faltered
Maraquita; ‘remember that—that—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>But this was a dangerous topic, on
which Mrs Courtney did not choose to
dilate.</p>

<p>‘I can remember nothing now, my
dear, except that Sir Russell is waiting
for your answer, and that I must go and
fetch him to you. Now, be a woman,
Maraquita! Think of all you owe to
yourself, and the brilliant future that lies
before you! I really believe I should go
out of my mind with grief if anything
happened to prevent it.’</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney walked back to the
house as quickly as she was able, and
Maraquita lay in the bamboo chair,
with her eyes closed, and the unshed tears
trembling like dewdrops on her long dark
lashes. She had not to wait long! In
another minute her mother had returned,
in company with the Governor, and Quita
had to disperse the vision of her handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
Spanish lover, with his graceful form
and romantic bearing, and open her eyes
upon a stout and pursy little Englishman,
with a bald head and uninteresting features,
and legs too short for his body.</p>

<p>But there was no mistaking the expression
of his beaming face, and the girl saw
at a glance that the matter had been concluded
for her, and she was already in
his eyes the future Lady Johnstone.</p>

<p>‘My dear Miss Courtney—may I not
say my dear Maraquita?’ he commenced,
‘I cannot tell you how flattered I feel
by your kind acceptance of my offer, nor
how much I hope it will be the forerunner
of our life-long happiness.’</p>

<p>He raised the hand she extended,
to his lips as he spoke, and she felt
compelled to reply, in a faltering
voice,—</p>

<p>‘I hope it will—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>‘I won’t hear of any doubts about it,’
exclaimed Mrs Courtney triumphantly. ‘I
feel <i>sure</i>, Sir Russell, that my sweet child’s
happiness is safe in your hands; and as for
yours—why, if the affection and duty of
a simple and innocent girl can secure it,
it will be as safe as her own. You must
not forget, my dear sir, that you have
chosen to honour a very young girl—almost
a child—with your preference,
and will, I know, make allowance for
any faults that may arise from ignorance
of the world and of society.’</p>

<p>‘I know that I have chosen the loveliest
and sweetest girl in San Diego!’
cried the Governor enthusiastically, ‘and
that it will be the aim of my life to surround
her with every luxury and pleasure
that I can afford; and as for her faults,
I shall never see any to make allowance
for.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>‘Oh, Sir Russell,’ replied Mrs Courtney,
in the same strain, ‘you must not
spoil my child! I know myself that her
chief fault is that which will mend every
day; still she is <i>very</i> young—there is no
denying that—and will often need a little
kindly counsel as to how she should act
in her high position.’</p>

<p>‘She will only need to be herself, and
to act on her own impulses, to make the
most charming hostess that ever presided
at the Government House. But we have
not yet spoken of when the marriage
is to take place, Mrs Courtney,—and I
hope you will persuade Maraquita not
to keep me waiting too long.’</p>

<p>‘You are very impatient,’ she replied,
smiling, ‘but you must not forget that
my dear child has been ill, and is still
very weak and fragile. Still, if you make
a point of it, I am sure neither Mr Courtney<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
nor myself will stand in the way of a
speedy wedding.’</p>

<p>‘But what will Miss Maraquita say?’
demanded the Governor, bending over
her.</p>

<p>‘My mother can decide for me,’ she
murmured faintly. ‘I have never disobeyed
you yet, mamma, have I?’</p>

<p>‘Never! my dear, never! You have
been the best and most dutiful of
daughters, and deferred to your parents’
wishes in all things—’</p>

<p>But here the remembrance of certain
late events put a sudden stop to Mrs
Courtney’s eloquence, and she watched
the crimson blood that rose to Quita’s
cheek, in alarm. The girl was still weak:
it was dangerous to provoke an emotion
which she might find it impossible to
quell.</p>

<p>‘But I think we have discussed this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
exciting topic sufficiently for to-day,’ she
continued. ‘Maraquita is easily upset,
and I should be sorry to see her thrown
back again. Will you settle the knotty
question of the wedding-day with me,
Sir Russell, after you have finished talking
to my daughter? I don’t fancy you
will find there are many difficulties in
the way—but we must think first
of Maraquita’s strength, and how we
can restore it for the important occasion.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly! that is the chief consideration,’
replied Sir Russell; ‘what do you
propose to do about it?’</p>

<p>‘I was thinking of taking her up to
the hill range for a week, to escape these
enervating land breezes. I think a little
change would do her more good than
anything else.’</p>

<p>‘The very thing!’ exclaimed Sir Russell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
‘and you can have the use of the Government
Bungalow, and all that is in it.
When will you start? To-morrow? If
so, I will send word at once to have
everything in readiness for your reception.
Don’t trouble yourself about taking your
carriage and horses, mine will be there,
and at your entire disposal. And I trust
that after the rest of a day or two, Maraquita
will permit me to join your party,
and accompany her on her excursions in
search of health. I have an Arab pony
that carries a lady to perfection, and, with
your leave, I will send it up for her use.
What does my <i>fiancée</i> say? Does my
proposal meet with her approval?’</p>

<p>‘She would be a very ungrateful girl,
and very hard to please, if it did not,’
said her mother, answering for her; and
then perceiving that Quita’s self-command
was almost at an end, and that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
on the point of breaking down, she added
playfully,—</p>

<p>‘And now I am going to be hard-hearted
and carry you off, Sir Russell, for
my poor child is overcome with all this
excitement, and unable to bear any more
at present. Please be good, and return
with me to the White House; and if you
will call upon us again this evening, I
have no doubt she will be calmer, and
better able to thank you for all your kind
offers on her behalf.’</p>

<p>The Governor rose at once (for he was
a gentleman, although he was ugly and
ill-formed), and took his leave. As he
did so, he stooped down and kissed
Maraquita on the cheek. It was not an
out-of-the-way thing for a newly-accepted
lover to do, but the salute, quietly as it
was given, seemed to sting her. She
did not resent it whilst her mother and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
Sir Russell Johnstone were in sight, but
as soon as the doors of the White House
had closed upon them, she hid her face
in her hands, and burst into a flood of
tears.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>HE was still weeping quietly,
when the branches of the
orange tree which formed a
leafy bower around her, were parted, and
a voice exclaimed, with passionate intensity,—</p>

<p>‘Maraquita!’</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet without
any effort to conceal her tears. Henri
de Courcelles stood beside her.</p>

<p>‘Oh, go!’ she implored, ‘go at once.
You don’t know the risk you are running.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
My mother suspects us, and she may be
back in another moment. For <i>my</i> sake,
Henri, go.’</p>

<p>‘Not unless you will tell me the cause
of your grief. Is it because this burden
is too heavy for you? If so, come with
me, and let us share it, and fight the
world together.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot talk with you about it now,
Henri,’ replied Maraquita, with a look
of alarm; ‘it is impossible. You <i>must</i>
leave me. I see Jessica coming from
the house.’</p>

<p>‘Then where will you meet me, for
I shall not rest until you have satisfied
my curiosity; besides, I have important
news for you about—it.’</p>

<p>This intelligence made Quita change
her mind. She was intensely anxious
to have the assurance of her own complete
safety, and she could be cunning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
enough where her inclinations were concerned.</p>

<p>‘Have you done—what I asked you?’
she gasped.</p>

<p>‘I have made everything right, but
I cannot explain the matter to you in a
moment, nor where there is any fear of
our being overheard.’</p>

<p>‘Wait for me in the oleander thicket,
then,’ cried Maraquita. ‘I will be there
in five minutes.’</p>

<p>Henri de Courcelles nodded acquiescence,
and disappeared as old Jessica came
up to her young mistress.</p>

<p>‘Missus Courtney send me to ask if my
missy like to have someting to eat and
drink now; and will missy come back to
de house, or will she have it brought out
here under de trees?’ asked the negress.</p>

<p>‘Neither, Jessica. Tell mamma I am
not hungry or thirsty, only very sleepy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and I want to be left alone for an hour
or two. I can call you when I wake.’</p>

<p>‘If missy sleepy, better come and
sleep in house,’ urged Jessica. ‘So
many flies and ’skeeters about here.’</p>

<p>‘I wish you would let me do as I
like, Jessica,’ said Quita, ‘and keep your
suggestions to yourself.’</p>

<p>‘I’se very sorry, missy. I won’t say
any more, only stop here and keep off
de flies and tings from your face.’</p>

<p>‘You’re enough to drive a saint mad!’
cried Maraquita, stamping her foot.
‘Didn’t I tell you I wanted to be left
alone? What is it to you if I like flies
and mosquitoes buzzing about me? Go
back to the house, and don’t come near
me again till I give you leave.’</p>

<p>The old nurse obeyed without a murmur;
but she <i>did</i> murmur, for all that.
The coloured people are very secretive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and can assume an appearance of complete
innocence, all the time they are
cognisant of their employer’s most important
secrets.</p>

<p>‘Ah! my poor little missy,’ muttered
Jessica to herself, as she shambled on
her bare flat feet towards the house, ‘you
think ole black nurse blind, but she see
too well. She know all about de baby
at Doctor’s bungalow, and who’s de fader
and moder of it, as well as you. And
she will see her little missy revenged,
before many moons is ober her head, into
de bargain. Cuss dat oberseer!’</p>

<p>Meanwhile Maraquita, having watched
Jessica into the house, through the
branches of the orange tree, stole out
the opposite side, and, keeping well out
of view of the windows, took her way
towards the oleander thicket, which lay
between her home and De Courcelles’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
bungalow. It was a wild patch of
flowering shrubs, densely planted together,
and forming a sufficient ambush
to conceal any number of persons from
the public gaze. There was a wooden
bench in one part of it, where Maraquita
and De Courcelles had often held their
moonlight trysts together; and there she
found him eager to tell his news, and
claim his reward.</p>

<p>Quita sunk down upon the bench, and
trembled. She was not only weak from
her recent illness, but she dreaded the
scene which might follow the impending
revelation.</p>

<p>‘You are far from well yet, my Quita,’
said Henri de Courcelles, as he folded his
arms about her trembling form; ‘but I
have something to tell you which will
set your mind at rest.’</p>

<p>‘Tell it to me quickly, then,’ rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Maraquita. ‘Have you sent it out of the
island? Are you <i>sure</i> I shall never hear
of it again?’</p>

<p>‘No, I cannot quite promise you that,’
replied De Courcelles, with an intuitive
disgust (even in the midst of his passion)
for her undisguised selfishness. ‘It has
never been in my hands, so it was impossible
I could form any plans for it.
But circumstances have fallen out so
fortunately, that I don’t see any chance
of suspicion falling upon <i>you</i>.’</p>

<p>‘What do you mean? I don’t understand
you,’ said Quita pettishly. ‘If it
is to remain in San Diego, the secret
may come out any day, and my only
safety will be in leaving the island.’</p>

<p>‘Wait a moment, dearest, and listen to
me. It seems that the day before the
Doctor’s death, he brought the child
home to his bungalow, where it now is—’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>‘With Lizzie? In the bungalow?’
cried Quita, turning ashy pale. ‘Oh, my
God! then all is over, and I am lost!’</p>

<p>‘Hush! hush! Maraquita. Nothing of
the sort. Liz refuses to say a word upon
the subject. <i>I</i> have questioned her narrowly;
so has your father; and all she
will answer is that before his death Dr
Fellows extracted a solemn oath from her
never to disclose anything concerning the
child, and that her lips are sealed.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but it will come out; it is sure
to come out some day!’ exclaimed Quita,
weeping, as she wrung her hands in
abject fear. ‘You have ruined me, Henri!
You have destroyed all my future prospects!
I shall be branded for ever as
a dishonest woman!’</p>

<p>‘But it is impossible! All the plantation—I
may say all San Diego—already
believes the child to be Lizzie’s own.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Maraquita stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>‘They believe <i>that</i>! But what does
Lizzie say?’</p>

<p>‘She can say nothing! Her lips are
sealed by her oath!’</p>

<p>‘Some day the shame may prove too
hard to bear, and they will be forced
open.’</p>

<p>‘It will be too late then to assert her
innocence. The world of San Diego is
quite convinced by this time that she is
the mother of the infant, and her attempts
to cast the blame on you will only appear
to be an impudent subterfuge. She has
no proof—or witness—to bring forward
in confirmation of the truth.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Lizzie,’ said Quita, in a low voice,
visions of past kindnesses on the part of
her adopted sister, and of a faithful life-long
affection, floated before her mind, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
made her tremble. Something—was it
the last effort made by her Good Angel
in her behalf—seemed to rise within her
heart, and prompt her to cry out that <i>it
must not be</i>, that she <i>could</i> not be guilty
of this dreadful wrong, and let her just
burthen lie on the shoulders of an innocent
woman. But then she remembered
the shame and the disgrace that would
ensue to her, and how her parents would
despise and reproach her, and Sir Russell
Johnstone would refuse to make her his
wife, and moral cowardice made her shiver
and remain silent.</p>

<p>‘Ay! poor Lizzie,’ echoed De Courcelles.
‘I am really sorry for the girl;
but what can be done? It is a choice
between two evils. Either <i>she</i> must be
sacrificed, or my peerless Maraquita. Do
you suppose I could hesitate between
them? There is one thing to be said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
however. Lizzie is not in your position.
She will not feel the disgrace so keenly
as you would. And, before long, Maraquita,
we may be able to relieve her of
her burthen.’</p>

<p>Maraquita did not like the last allusion.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see <i>how</i>,’ she answered lamely.</p>

<p>‘Have you forgotten, then, what you
promised, when you asked me to assist
you to escape the inevitable blame of the
consequences of our mutual love,—that, if
your parents refused to sanction our marriage,
you would elope with me to Santa
Lucia, and not return until we were man
and wife in the eyes of the law, as we
are now in the eyes of Heaven?’</p>

<p>‘But you have <i>not</i> done as I asked
you,’ she replied evasively. ‘I don’t see
that you have done anything. <i>It</i> is still
here, closer at hand even than I thought
it was, and (whatever you may say) liable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
at any moment to be brought home to
my door. And there is another danger,
Henri. Mamma has discovered our secret—how,
I am unable to say, but she has
told me so pretty plainly, and also that
she will keep it only on one condition—’</p>

<p>‘And that is—’</p>

<p>‘That I accept the proposals of Sir
Russell Johnstone.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You shall not!</i>’ cried her lover indignantly.
‘I will not stand by quietly
and see the woman I consider <i>my wife</i>
handed over to that bald-headed old
Governor. I will go straight up to
Mr Courtney sooner, and confess the
truth, and ask his pardon for what I
have done. Surely he would never
wish you to marry another man, if he
knew what has taken place between us.
And if he persists in dragging you to
the altar, I will tear you from your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
bridegroom’s arms, and stab you to the
heart, before he shall claim what is
mine.’</p>

<p>Quita’s star-like eyes dilated with
terror. She knew something of what
the Spanish and Creole blood is capable
of doing when roused, and foresaw
bloodshed—perhaps murder—if Henri de
Courcelles did not have his own way.
And yet, to give up the brilliant prospect
before her, in order to become an
overseer’s wife, and one whose maiden
reputation would be lightly spoken of,
seemed to be impossible. Why had
she ever entangled her feet in a net
which threatened to drag her down to
a life of obloquy and shame? To what
friend could she turn in her great need?
Suddenly the idea flashed across her
mind that she would confess everything
to her mother. Mrs Courtney already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
knew (or had guessed) the truth, and
counselled her daughter on the best
mode of escaping its results. She was
very anxious to see Maraquita Lady
Johnstone. If making a clean breast
of her secret brought a certain amount
of recrimination on her head, it would at
the same time secure her an ally with
whom to fight this terrible battle for a
name and a position in life. For the
first time hope and comfort seemed to
enter her breast. If her mother were
on her side, she felt she could defy
Henri de Courcelles, and Liz Fellows,
and the world. All their assertions
would be taken as impudent lies, and
only secure their own immediate banishment
from Beauregard. But, meanwhile,
her lover must be quieted and conciliated,
and Maraquita knew how to
do it full well. She had scarcely conceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
the notion how to act in the
future, before her white arms were
wreathed about his neck.</p>

<p>‘Henri,’ she cried, with her lips to his,
‘don’t speak to me like that! Don’t think
of such a thing, for Heaven’s sake! Do
you imagine that <i>I</i> would ever consent
to be placed in such a position, or
that any amount of tyranny would make
me marry a man against my will? Let
the worst come to the worst, dear; let
mamma tell my father of our intrigue;
it will only result in your having to
leave San Diego. Whether <i>I</i> shall be
able to go too, remains to be proved.
I am under age, you know, and if papa
chooses to lock me up, or send me to
England, I suppose he can. But even
<i>that</i> will be better than being forced to
marry a man I don’t love; and you
know that I shall always remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
you, dearest, and think of the time
that is past, as the happiest portion of
my life.’</p>

<p>Henri de Courcelles looked sullen and
suspicious. The clasping arms were very
sweet, and the ripe lips very tempting,
but there was a false ring in Quita’s
speech, which made itself apparent to his
senses, although his judgment could not
detect it. There was no fault to be
found with her words, yet they inspired
him with distrust, and he felt certain
that she was betraying whilst she kissed
him.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what to think of you,
Maraquita,’ he said presently. ‘I suppose
you love me, in your way, but you
seem very ready to fall in with your
parents’ plans to get rid of me.’</p>

<p>‘But what <i>could</i> I do, Henri, if my
father was determined to separate us?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Am I not completely in his power?
Our only chance appears to me to
lie in secrecy, and yet you speak as
if you would disclose the affair to all
San Diego.’</p>

<p>‘And if I hold my tongue and remain
quiet, what then? You will marry Sir
Russell Johnstone before my very eyes,
and I shall have to grin and bear it.’</p>

<p>‘We are the most unfortunate people
in the world’, sighed Maraquita, with
mock sentimentality.</p>

<p>‘You mean that <i>I</i> am the most unfortunate
man in the world, ever to have
set my heart on a girl who doesn’t care
two straws for me. I can see through
you now, Maraquita. You were willing
enough to commit the sin, but you are
too great a coward to face the consequences
of it. You have deceived and
disobeyed your parents over and over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
again, when it suited your pleasure to do
so, but when it comes to a question of
marrying the man you profess to love,
you take refuge behind the transparent
screen of filial duty and affection. I was
good enough for your lover, it appears,
but I am <i>not</i> good enough to be your
husband. You have higher views in
prospect for yourself, and I may go anywhere,—be
kicked out of my appointment,
and cast homeless on San Diego—what
does it signify to you, so long
as you become Lady Johnstone, and
have plenty to eat and drink, and a
spotless reputation. But it shall not be!
You have made yourself <i>mine</i>, and I
refuse to give you up. If you attempt
to become the wife of any other man,
whether in deference to your parents’
wishes, or your own, I will blast your
name from north to south, till the commonest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
fellow on the island would refuse
to give you his. Every black in San
Diego shall know <i>what</i> you are, a light
love, a false woman, and a heartless mother.’</p>

<p>‘You shall not—<i>you dare not</i>!’ gasped
Maraquita, now thoroughly frightened.</p>

<p>‘You shall see what I can <i>dare</i>!’ he
exclaimed wildly. ‘For I will take your
life and my own, sooner than give you
up to another.’</p>

<p>And with that Henri de Courcelles
walked away, and left her sitting
there by herself. As soon as she was
convinced he was not coming back
again, Quita rose, and with trembling
steps walked slowly back to the White
House. He had succeeded in completely
alarming her. She had never
seen him like this before, and he was
terrible in his anger. His black eyes
had gleamed on her like polished steel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
and his hand had involuntarily sought
his side, as though ready to grasp an invisible
stiletto. Quita felt certain he
would be capable of any violence, if not
restrained, and fear lent her boldness.
She would secure one friend at least in
her extremity, and whatever it cost her
she would confide her trouble to her
mother. She found Mrs Courtney
alone in her own room, lying on a sofa,
with bare feet, and the last novel that
had reached San Diego in her hand.
But as she saw Maraquita enter the
chamber, she raised herself to a sitting
position.</p>

<p>‘My dearest child! what is the
matter? You are looking quite ill again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, mamma, mamma,’ cried Quita,
sinking at her mother’s feet, ‘I am so
unhappy!’</p>

<p>And then, in a broken voice, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
her face still hidden, she told the story
of her disgrace, and the danger which
appeared to threaten her.</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney listened in silence. She
had suspected the cause of her daughter’s
illness, and the author of her ruin, but
she was hardly prepared to hear there
was a living witness to her shame domiciled
so close to Beauregard. Her naturally
sallow complexion turned almost livid
with horror, and her unwieldy frame
shook with agitation. And when the
girl had finished her miserable recital,
all her mother could utter was,—</p>

<p>‘Oh, Maraquita, Maraquita, I couldn’t
have believed it of you!’</p>

<p>‘Mother, don’t speak to me like that!
I know I have been very wicked, but
I have no friend but you, and if <i>you</i> desert
me, I shall be lost. Oh, mother, save
me this once, and I will do everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
you ask me in the future. You want
me to became Lady Johnstone, don’t
you? But you must think of some
means of stopping Henri’s tongue, or I
never shall be. I did not think he would
be so spiteful and revengeful! He says
he will stab me at the very altar.’</p>

<p>‘That is all talk, my dear! he will do
no such thing! He shall be sent out
of Beauregard before a week is over his
head; and if he dares to assail your character,
your father shall have him punished
for it. But listen to me, Quita. There
is only one way to fight this scandal, and
that is to deny everything. Now, let
me understand you plainly. Are you <i>sure</i>
that no one but Dr Fellows and his
daughter knew the secret of this birth?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Quite</i> sure, mamma! The Doctor told
me so over and over again; and I don’t
think Lizzie knows <i>whose</i> baby it is—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
if she does, she has taken an oath never
to reveal it—and Lizzie will keep her
oath!’ said Maraquita, with complete
faith in the fidelity of her friend.</p>

<p>‘There was no other person in the
house at the time?’</p>

<p>‘No one, mamma.’</p>

<p>‘Then your course is plain. Whoever
dares to mention this story to you, or at
whatever time it may crop up against you,
<i>deny it entirely</i>. Say you have never
heard of such a thing before, and you
are entirely ignorant how it could have
originated. <i>I</i>—as your mother—will
corroborate your statement, and we will
uphold our assertion before the world.
Lizzie Fellows is really the only witness
that can come against you, and she will
not break her promise, I am sure of that.</p>

<p>‘As for that villain De Courcelles, your
father shall give him a summary dismissal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and anything he may say in his rage will
be taken for revenge. He can <i>prove</i>
nothing. He has only his bare word to
give for it, and who would believe him
against your own parents? Meanwhile,
dearest, the sooner your marriage takes
place the better, and then you will feel
safe. But whatever you do, Maraquita,
never acknowledge your shame again,
even to De Courcelles. You never know
who may overhear it. Try to believe it
has never been, and then you will act as
though it had never been. As for marrying
your father’s overseer, it is out of the
question, and like his presumption to
dream of it. As if he hadn’t done you
harm enough already, without wishing to
hamper you for life! It’s like the unreasonable
selfishness of men. But you
may make your mind easy, my dear,
your mother will save you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>‘Oh, mamma, how I wish I could
go away somewhere, and never see nor
hear anything of him again!’ sobbed
Maraquita.</p>

<p>‘So you shall, Quita, if you will only
have a little patience. But cease crying
now, my child, or you will make yourself
ill. Lie down on my couch, and try to
go to sleep. I won’t let you leave the
house again until Monsieur de Courcelles
has quitted the plantation.’</p>

<p>And with a kiss of forgiveness, Mrs
Courtney left her frail daughter to repose.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE next morning Liz was walking
up the avenue of orange
trees that led to the White
House, with her eyes fixed upon the
ground, and her brow wrinkled with perplexity.
After many hours of painful
deliberation, she had come to the conclusion
to take the advice of Captain
Norris, and beg Maraquita to relieve her
of the intolerable burden of shame she
bore for her sake; but <i>how</i> to accuse her
adopted sister of her sin, troubled her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
beyond measure. She felt so deeply for
her youth and betrayed innocence. Such
a well of divine compassion for the injured
girl was mingled with her own
horror of the deed, that she scarcely knew
whether she should feel most inclined to
commiserate with, or to blame her. Liz
pictured Quita to herself writhing on
the ground for very shame at the discovery
of her weakness, bright-eyed, dusky-haired
Maraquita, who had always seemed
so much to be envied and admired, prostrate
in her humiliation, and her generous
heart bled in anticipation of her sister’s
pain. She conned over and over again
the words in which she would break the
truth to her, trying to make them as
tender and little accusing as she could.
She would endeavour (she thought) to
first gain Quita’s confidence, and then to
make her understand that, if she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
only do what was just, in confessing the
truth to her parents, Liz would be her
friend, and the friend of her little daughter,
to their lives’ end. But what she was
about to ask of Quita was a very serious
thing, and she doubted if the girl’s strength
of mind would carry her through it.</p>

<p>She did not ring for admittance when
she reached the White House. She had
been accustomed to enter and leave it as
she chose, and experienced no difficulty
in finding her way at once to the chamber
where Maraquita spent most of her morning
hours.</p>

<p>This was an apartment adjoining her
bedroom, and furnished more with a view
to the repose which is so essential in the
torrid climate of the West Indies, than
to the pursuit of any active work. Its
French windows, opening on the garden,
were shaded by green jalousies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
through which the luxuriant creepers
thrust their tendrils and their leaves; the
marble floor was strewn with plaited
mats of various coloured straws; the furniture
consisted of a couple of bamboo
lounges and a marble table, on which
stood a silver tray bearing fruit and
cooling drinks. The only ornaments it
contained were a large mirror and a
couple of handsome vases filled with
roses. Everything about the room was
conducive to coolness and repose; and
Maraquita, attired in white muslin, with
a palm leaf in her hand, and stretched
full length on one of the couches, with
her eyes half closed, was a personification
of the goddess of Sleep or Indolence, or
perhaps both.</p>

<p>She started, and coloured slightly as
Liz slipped into the room through the
verandah. Her last conversation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Henri de Courcelles was in her mind.
She had been thinking of it as Liz entered,
and a secret intuition made her
feel that her adopted sister would allude
to the subject. A craven fear took possession
of her, and made her heart beat
to suffocation; but only for a moment.
The next she had remembered her
mother’s caution and promised championship,
and had resolved to carry out her
advice (if necessary) to the very letter.
As she sank back upon her couch, Lizzie
advanced towards her with affectionate
solicitude.</p>

<p>‘Have I startled you, Quita? I hope
not. It seems so long since we met;
and so much has happened since then,
that I felt I must come up and see you
to-day. How are you, dear? Quite
strong again?’</p>

<p>As she sat down by the girl’s side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and laid her hand tenderly upon her
arm, Quita turned pettishly away.</p>

<p>‘That is rather a silly question for a
lady doctor to ask me, Lizzie. How
can I be quite strong again after such
a nasty attack of fever? I am as weak
as I can well be, and mamma is going
to take me up to the hill range to-morrow
or next day for change of
air.’</p>

<p>‘I am glad of that, dear. It will be
the best thing for you, for you must have
suffered much, my poor Quita, I am sure,
both in mind and body.’</p>

<p>Quita did not like this thrust, but she
parried it bravely.</p>

<p>‘Well, I <i>did</i> suffer with the fever, as
you know, and the only wonder is that
it didn’t kill me, as it has done so many
of the coolies. It was your poor father
who saved my life. And then that <i>he</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
should go himself! I have felt that
terribly, Liz. I was very fond of him.
He was like a second father to me, and
his sudden death has cut us all up, as
well as you.’</p>

<p>There were tears in Maraquita’s voice
as she spoke, which brought the kindred
drops welling up to Lizzie’s eyes, and
for a few moments the girls wept together
as for a common loss.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Quita,’ said Liz, as soon as she
could speak calmly again, ‘I know that
you and your father and mother have felt
for me in my trouble, for, kind as you
have been to us, you can never realise
the depth of it. My father was my world.
He stood between me and every anxiety,
and now that he is gone, I feel as if
I stood alone, the centre of a storm
of suspicion, and accusation, and reproach.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Maraquita paled under this allusion,
but she felt obliged to say,—</p>

<p>‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘Can you ask me, Quita?’ exclaimed
Liz suddenly. ‘Is it possible that the
rumours that are afloat concerning me
have failed to reach your ears? Mr
Courtney told me that he had heard
them. Surely he repeated them to you.’</p>

<p>‘No, papa has told me nothing, and I
don’t know what rumours you allude to,’
replied Quita; but had the room not been
darkened to shut out the morning heat,
Lizzie must have seen the crimson blood
that rushed to her face with fear of what
was coming.</p>

<p>‘Then I must tell you,’ said Lizzie,
drawing nearer to the couch, while she
looked cautiously about the room to be
sure that no one was within hearing.
‘Indeed I came up here this morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
expressly to tell you, for the burden of
secrecy and shame is more than I can
bear.’</p>

<p>Whilst Lizzie beat about the bush, as
though afraid to mention the forbidden
topic, Quita had felt timid and constrained,
but now that she seemed prepared
to speak out, the defiance that is
born of fear entered the younger girl’s
breast, and emboldened her to say or do
anything in the defence of her honour.</p>

<p>‘What secrecy? What shame? What
have you been doing, Lizzie?’ she exclaimed,
with well-feigned surprise. ‘You
talk in riddles to me to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, you have heard nothing, Quita.
I can see that. You do not know the
terrible duty that has been laid upon me.
But turn your face this way, dear, and
let me whisper to you. Don’t mind what
I may say, Quita. Remember that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
your sister, who has known you from
a baby, and that I sympathise with and
feel for you in any trouble or sorrow you
may have to endure. You remember the
night you came to our bungalow?’</p>

<p>‘I remember the night I was <i>told</i>
I went there, Liz; but I was half delirious
with the fever, and can vouch for
nothing myself.’</p>

<p>‘I can well understand that you
were half crazy with fear and pain,
dearest, but it was not the fever that
made you so.’</p>

<p>‘The Doctor said it was the fever,’
argued Maraquita, with wide-open, innocent
eyes. ‘He told papa and mamma
so.’</p>

<p>‘I know he did, for <i>your</i> sake, and
that they believed it. He extracted a
solemn oath from me at the same time,
never to reveal what I might see or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
hear that night. And I never <i>have</i> revealed
it, Quita, and I never <i>will</i>. It
shall lie hidden in my heart until my
death. Only <i>you</i> must help me to bear
it, or I shall die.’</p>

<p>Lizzie was sobbing now, though very
quietly, behind the shelter of her hands,
whilst Maraquita lay on the couch
silent but pondering what she would say.</p>

<p>‘Speak to me,’ cried Lizzie presently.
‘Say something, for God’s sake, and
put me out of my pain.’</p>

<p>‘What am I to say?’ replied Maraquita.
‘You frighten me when you
talk like that. Has anything terrible
happened since your poor father’s death,
and how can <i>I</i> help you out of it?’</p>

<p>‘I will tell you what has happened,’
said Lizzie presently. ‘Mammy Lila
is dead, and the child is with me, and
every one is talking about it, and saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
it is mine. What am I to do, Quita—what
<i>am</i> I to do? I cannot speak,
because my lips are closed by the oath
my father made me take; and if I <i>could</i>
speak, do you think I would betray
my dearest friend? And can I send
it from me—the poor, helpless, tender
little creature who has no one to look
after it and love it but myself?’</p>

<p>‘But whose child is it?’ inquired
Maraquita, with her dark eyes fixed
full on those of her adopted sister.</p>

<p>Lizzie regarded her for a moment
in silent consternation. Was it possible
that Quita was in ignorance of her
child’s birth, and had her late father
managed so skilfully as to keep her
unaware of what had happened? Such
things <i>had</i> been. But the next minute
Liz had rejected the idea with scorn.
At any rate Maraquita must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
known what lay before her when she
found her way to the Doctor’s bungalow,
and if she affected ignorance now,
it was only because she was unaware
that Lizzie knew the whole truth.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Maraquita,’ she exclaimed, ‘don’t
be afraid of confessing it to me, for
I know everything! My father was
obliged to confide in me. He could
not have managed without my assistance.
But my oath seals my lips to
all the world but you. But is it right
to keep such a secret from your father
and mother, especially when doing so
involves the ruin of any other woman?
You don’t know what the charge of
that little infant has brought upon me?
Even Mr Courtney suspects my honesty.
And as for Monsieur de Courcelles—’</p>

<p>‘What has Monsieur de Courcelles to
do with it?’ cried Quita hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Lizzie coloured. She had never spoken
of her relations with Henri de Courcelles
to Quita before, but this was no time to let
feeling get the better of justice.</p>

<p>‘He has everything to do with <i>me</i>,’ she
answered, in a low tone. ‘Quita, I have
never told you before, that I am engaged
to be married to Monsieur de Courcelles.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i>—engaged to be married—to
<i>Henri</i>? Oh, it is not true! You are
deceiving me!’ exclaimed Quita, as she
sprang to a sitting position, and turned a
face of ashy pallor to her companion.</p>

<p>But Lizzie suspected no more than she
saw. She only thought that Quita was
astonished that she should have been kept
in the dark with regard to so important
a subject, and hastened to defend her own
conduct.</p>

<p>‘Indeed, it <i>is</i> true! I daresay you are
surprised that I should not have told you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Quita (for I have told you almost everything),
but I have felt so deeply about it,
that I <i>could</i> not speak; and our engagement
has never been made public, though
it has lasted over a year.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i>—engaged to <i>Henri de Courcelles</i>!’
repeated Quita incredulously.</p>

<p>‘Yes! Although he has broken it off, of
his own accord, and left me, I cannot feel
that I am free from him. For I love him,
Quita. I love him with my whole heart
and soul. I did not think it was in me to
love any creature as I love him. And
since we have parted, I have been unable
to sleep, or eat, or drink, for longing after
him,—longing, above all things, to clear my
character in his eyes, even though I never
saw him afterwards. Oh, Quita, I must,
I <i>must</i> do this! To live on letting him
think me false and frail, will kill me!
If you will not help me out of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
awful dilemma, my death will be on your
head.’</p>

<p>But the news she had just heard had
hardened Maraquita’s heart. All the love
she was capable of feeling had been given
to De Courcelles, and if he and Lizzie had
combined to deceive her, why they might
suffer for it. That was all she thought of,
as she clenched her teeth upon her upper
lip, to prevent her betraying her emotion.</p>

<p>‘Maraquita! won’t you save my love to
me?’ wailed Lizzie. ‘All I ask is to
clear my name in the eyes of Henri
de Courcelles, and then the rest of the
world may think and say what they
choose.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t in the least understand what
you are driving at,’ replied Maraquita.
‘What can <i>I</i> do to make up your quarrel?
Monsieur de Courcelles and you are both
old enough to look after yourselves. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
he won’t believe you, he is not likely to
believe <i>me</i>.’</p>

<p>‘But I cannot speak—my lips are sealed,’
cried Lizzie wildly; ‘and he will not accept
my word, instead of an explanation. Don’t
you understand me, Quita? Henri has
heard this scandalous report about the
child, and believes it to be mine. He
demands the name of the mother, and no
one but you can satisfy him. Oh, Quita,
release me from this awful vow, that
threatens to ruin my character and blast
my whole life! Think, dear—is it fair
that I should lose everything I love and
value most, because of your fault? Be
brave and generous enough to share the
blame with me, and I promise you before
God that it shall never go any further.’</p>

<p>Maraquita sat straight up on her couch,
and stared at her adopted sister.</p>

<p>‘What do you want me to do? Speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
plainly, for I do not comprehend your
meaning.’</p>

<p>‘I want you to tell your parents what
you have done. They will pity, and love,
and forgive you, Quita, as I do. They
will feel it was your youth and ignorance
that were at fault, and not your heart;
and you will feel happier, my poor sister,
when your mother has shared your secret,
and forgiven it. I want you to tell Mr
and Mrs Courtney that the child in my
bungalow is yours.’</p>

<p>‘<i>What!</i>’ cried Quita shrilly. ‘You
want me to tell a lie in order to screen
yourself?’</p>

<p>‘<i>A lie!</i>’ repeated Lizzie. ‘You know
it is not a lie; you know when you came
to us that night that you were delivered
of a daughter, and that my poor father
took charge of it for you. Oh, Quita,
if you could see her,—her little waxen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
hands and feet, her wistful dark eyes, so
like your own, and her tiny mouth, which
just begins to smile, your mother’s heart
would yearn to claim her for your own!’</p>

<p>For one moment Quita trembled at
the picture Liz had conjured up, but
the next, fear of ruining her own prospects
crushed the softer feeling in her
heart.</p>

<p>‘I deny it!’ she exclaimed loudly. ‘I
deny every word you have uttered. You
are either mad, or you mistake me for
some other woman. How <i>dare</i> you insinuate
that I have ever had a child?’</p>

<p>‘<i>You deny it!</i>’ echoed Lizzie, rising
to her feet. ‘You can actually look me
in the face, and deny it, Quita?’</p>

<p>‘Most emphatically I do, and resent
the insult you have laid upon me. I
know nothing about the child which is
in your bungalow. It may be yours, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
any other woman’s, but it certainly is not
<i>mine</i>; and if my parents heard you had
accused me of such a dishonour, they
would turn you from their doors!’</p>

<p>‘What is all this about?’ exclaimed
Mrs Courtney, as she entered the room.
‘Lizzie, you ought to know better than
to let Maraquita excite herself with talking,
when she has scarcely recovered
from her late illness. She will have a
relapse, if we do not take care.’</p>

<p>She had heard from Jessica that the
Doctor’s daughter had entered the house,
and, fearful of what she might have come
to say, had hastened to the rescue of
her daughter. Lizzie stood before her,
silent and confused, but Quita appealed
to her mother’s protection at once.</p>

<p>‘Mamma, just hear what Lizzie has
told me. She says there is a baby at her
bungalow which was left in the charge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
her father, and she accuses me of being
the mother of it, and wants me to tell a
lie to you and papa, in order to screen
herself from suspicion.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Lizzie</i> accuses <i>you</i> of being <i>a mother</i>!’
exclaimed Mrs Courtney, with well-acted
surprise. ‘Oh, it is <i>impossible</i>! Quita,
you are dreaming!’</p>

<p>‘Tell mamma if I am dreaming, Lizzie!
Repeat to her what you said just now.’</p>

<p>‘I shall do no such thing, Quita! I
said what I did to you in confidence, and
I refuse to repeat it to any one.’</p>

<p>‘Because you know how mamma would
resent such a foul calumny. Oh, mamma,’
continued Quita to her mother, ‘what
have I ever done to be accused of such
a dreadful thing? What would Sir
Russell say if he heard of it?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot believe my ears,’ said Mrs
Courtney. ‘Do I hear aright, Lizzie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
that you have <i>dared</i> to link my daughter’s
name with such a shameful story? What
induced you to do it? Speak! I must
have an answer.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot speak, Mrs Courtney; I have
nothing to say.’</p>

<p>‘Because you know yourself to be
guilty. Don’t imagine that we have not
heard the scandal that is abroad concerning
you. But I little thought you would
have the audacity to try and throw the
blame upon my poor Maraquita, she who
has been like a sister to you.’</p>

<p>‘I have never denied the benefits which
I and my poor father have received from
your family, Mrs Courtney, nor been ungrateful
for them.’</p>

<p>‘And what do you call your conduct
of this morning, then? You have deceived
us all, Lizzie,—Mr Courtney, myself,
and your poor father. We thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
you a pure and good girl, or you never
would have been allowed to associate with
my daughter.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>am</i> pure,’ interposed Lizzie, with
the indignant tears standing on her hot
cheeks. ‘I have done nothing to make
you regret the favours you have shown
me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t speak to me like that, Lizzie,
when you know that you are the mother
of a child which you dare not own.’</p>

<p>‘I am not! I am <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span>!’ cried the girl,
half choked with her emotion and sense
of impotency to resent the charge made
against her.</p>

<p>‘And I say you <i>are</i>,’ continued Mrs
Courtney, ‘and all San Diego says it
with me. And, not content with degrading
yourself, you would try to degrade
<i>my</i> daughter also. Shame upon you!
Is this your gratitude? You who, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
for our bounty would have been pointed
at all your days as the daughter of a
felon, who have now lowered yourself
beyond the ordinary level of your sex.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mrs Courtney, say what you like
to me, but spare the memory of my dead
father!’ cried Lizzie, through her sobs.</p>

<p>‘If I have not spared it, you have only
yourself, and your own conduct, to blame.
I have been very good to you hitherto,
Lizzie, but I can be so no longer. You
have raised a barrier between us with
your own hand. For the sake of his
old friendship for your father, Mr Courtney
wishes you to remain on the plantation,
but you are no fit companion for
Maraquita, and from this day you must
consider the doors of the White House
are closed against you.’</p>

<p>‘You will not find me attempt to
alter your decision, Mrs Courtney. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
came up here this morning to ask
Maraquita to do me a simple act of
justice, but she has refused it, and I
can no longer look upon her as my sister
and my friend, nor shall I have any
wish to seek her society.’</p>

<p>‘Insolent!’ exclaimed Mrs Courtney.
‘Why, under no circumstances would
you be permitted to do so. Maraquita
is engaged to be married to the Governor
of the island, Sir Russell Johnstone.
In a few weeks she will be reigning at
Government House, and will receive
no lady there who cannot vouch for
the possession of an unspotted reputation.
So now perhaps you will see
the harm you have done yourself by
your impudent attempt to forge off your
own error upon her.’</p>

<p>‘It would have made no difference to
my behaviour, madam, if Maraquita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
had already been the Governor’s wife.
The blameless burden laid upon me
still remains, and she will not lift it by
the raising of her little finger. I suppose
it is my fate to suffer and be
silent. But I think the time will come
when Quita will be sorry she had not
more pity for me to-day.’</p>

<p>‘Mamma, mamma,’ cried Quita hysterically,
‘tell her to go! I can bear
no more of her reproaches. It is wicked
of her to speak like that. You know
that I have done nothing; but if such
a story were to come to Sir Russell’s
ears, it might ruin me for ever.’</p>

<p>‘It shall <i>not</i> come to his ears!’ exclaimed
Mrs Courtney angrily; ‘and if
you attempt to repeat it, Elizabeth
Fellows, I will have your name, and
your dead father’s name, branded from
one end of San Diego to the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
until not a soul in the island shall speak
to you. See if I do not.’</p>

<p>‘You will never have the opportunity
to carry out your cruel threat, madam.
I have told your daughter, and I tell
you, that my vow of secrecy to my beloved
father is sacred, and nothing shall
make me break it. From this hour, I
shall never mention the subject to any
living creature again.’</p>

<p>And with those words Liz turned on
her heel and walked out of the White
House. As she disappeared, Maraquita
threw herself into her mother’s arms in
a burst of tears.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I am lost—I am lost!’ she cried,
trembling with fear. ‘We have made
her angry, and she may go and tell the
story everywhere, from revenge. How I
wish I had never seen De Courcelles.
It was wicked of him to take advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
of me like that. And all the time he
was engaged to be married to Lizzie.
Oh, mother, I hate him—<i>I hate him!</i>
I wish that he was dead!’</p>

<p>It is the proof of an ephemeral and
fancied passion that directly misfortune
or peril comes upon it, it turns to reproaching
and dislike. There is little
need to say that Maraquita’s love for
Henri de Courcelles was founded on a
basis of self-esteem. Had it been otherwise,
their mutual error would have made
her cling all the closer to him as her one
haven of safety.</p>

<p>‘If he <i>is</i> engaged to her, my dear,’
replied Mrs Courtney, with a view to
consolation, ‘so much the better. They
are a very suitable pair, and their marriage
would rid you of a troublesome
suitor. I have heard something of it
before, but subsequent events made me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
think I was mistaken. But I don’t like
Monsieur de Courcelles. I consider him
a dangerous enemy, and should be glad
to know that he had settled down in life.’</p>

<p>‘But you <i>promised</i> me that papa should
send him away from Beauregard,’ said
Quita fearfully.</p>

<p>‘And so he shall, my love, as soon
as ever we are on the hill range. You
may rest assured of that. Only we have
no power to send him out of San Diego,
and he may prove troublesome to us
yet. However, I have my own story to
tell papa, and it is one that will provide
against any emergency. But the first
thing to be done, Quita, is to get you
away; and the next, to make you Lady
Johnstone. Then we shall be perfectly
safe.’</p>

<p>‘You will take care that no one else
comes in to see me to-day,’ said Quita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
languidly, ‘for I feel quite worn out by
the annoyance I have undergone?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly, my dearest girl. Jessica
shall see that you are not disturbed. And
now try and sleep, Quita, and don’t be
afraid that there will be any repetition of
so disagreeable a scene. I think I have
let Miss Lizzie have a piece of my mind,
and that she will see I mean what I said.
Depend upon it, my dear, that no ill-natured
stories or repetitions can ever
harm you in the future. The girl is too
honest to break her word; and if she
suffers a little from keeping it, she deserves
as much, for her mean attempt to coerce
you. Now, you must promise me to think
no more about the matter.’</p>

<p>Maraquita gave the required promise,
because she wanted to be left alone; but as
she lay in the silent and shaded room, the
description that her adopted sister had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
given her of little waxen hands and fingers,
of two dark wistful eyes, and a baby mouth
beginning to smile, recurred again and
again to her, until something very like
the longing of motherhood stirred in her
bosom, and made her sob herself to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">L</span>IZ FELLOWS went home that
day sadder than she had been
before. Her lover’s defalcation
had been a natural sequence to the misfortune
that had overtaken her, compared
to this. He had judged her harshly, and
without proof, but he at least believed (or
she thought he did) that she had been
untrue to him, and his anger and contempt
were those of a dishonoured man. But
Maraquita’s conduct admitted of no such
palliation. She <i>knew</i> better than any one
else, that Liz was innocent of the charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
laid against her, and yet she could coolly
deny the fact, and appeal to her mother to
join her in turning her adopted sister from
their doors. She could shield herself behind
the humiliation of her friend,—deny
her maternity, and delegate her sacred
duties—her most holy feelings—to another
woman.</p>

<p>‘Feelings! Duties!’ Liz stamped her
foot impatiently, as the terms occurred to
her mind. Maraquita <i>had</i> no feelings, and
recognised no duty. She was lower than
the feeble little animals, who would die
sooner than desert their young. She had
brought a helpless infant—presumably the
infant of her lover—into the world, and
would not even acknowledge it was hers.
<i>Who</i> was the father of this child, thought
Liz, that he could stand by quietly and
see the desertion of his offspring? Had
<i>he</i> no natural instincts, any more than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
partner of his sin? Would they <i>both</i>
leave their infant to the tender mercies
of the world, whilst they went their own
ways—one, to be married to the Governor
of San Diego—the other, Heaven best
knew where? Well, she had staked her
last chance, and lost it. Henri de Courcelles
would never now receive the proof
of her innocence. He was lost to her for
ever, and she must bear the burden of
shame laid upon her guiltless head as
best she might. As she re-entered the
bungalow, a wail from Quita’s hapless
infant smote her with compassion.</p>

<p>‘My poor little orphan!’ she exclaimed,
as she took it in her arms. ‘You are
an outcast as well as myself. You have
no parents worthy of the name, and I
shall never know the joy of being a
mother. We must comfort each other
under this great calamity as best we may.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
They say you are my little daughter, and
since they say so, I almost wish you
were. But I will love you like a daughter,
and teach you to love me like a mother,
and so you shall comfort my bruised
heart, and I will try and make your life
happy.’</p>

<p>Up to that moment Rosa had fed
and washed the baby, and slept with it
in her arms, but now Lizzie took all
these sweet maternal duties into her own
hands. She nursed it all that day, and
when night came she laid it in her own
bed. When it was fairly asleep, and
Rosa had run over to the negroes’
quarters to chat with her friends, Liz
sat down to her sewing in the sitting-room,
calmer and less perplexed than
she had been for days past.</p>

<p>Up to that time she had cherished
hope, but now all hope was over. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
knew the worst. It was bitterly hard
to know it, but at all events suspense
was at an end, and there was no new
trouble to learn. As she sat by the
shaded lamplight, wondering if Mr Courtney
knew the name of her father’s
family, and if the knowledge could be
of any use to herself, she heard a light
footstep creeping softly along the verandah,
a footstep which she recognised
at once, and which she had been wont
to jump up and welcome. But now
Liz sat still, with burning cheeks bent
over her needlework. If Maraquita
wished to come to any terms with her,
she must be the one to propose them.
Liz had prayed her last prayer to the companion
of her childhood. Presently a very
low and fearful voice called her by her name.</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, Lizzie! Are you quite alone?’</p>

<p>But Lizzie refused to answer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Maraquita was compelled to advance into
the room. She looked very white and
scared, and the folds of her long mantle
fell round a fragile figure.</p>

<p>‘Lizzie! Why will you not speak to
me? Papa and mamma have gone to
the theatre with Sir Russell Johnstone;
but I excused myself on the plea of
a headache, so that I might come and
see you.’</p>

<p>‘And what do you want with me?’
demanded Lizzie coldly.</p>

<p>‘Cannot you guess? I am so unhappy
at what took place this morning.
I shall not rest until things are right
again between us.’</p>

<p>‘I do not understand you, Quita! I
conclude you spoke the truth this morning,
or what you believed to be the
truth, and I have nothing more to say
upon the subject.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>‘Oh, Lizzie, have pity on me! You
know it was not the truth; but what can
I do? Everything that makes life valuable
to me seems slipping through my
fingers. I could not make up my mind
to confess to my own ruin.’</p>

<p>‘And so you would ruin me instead—I,
who have been like a sister to you?
You would save your own character at
the expense of mine?’</p>

<p>‘But not for always, Lizzie. Only let
me get this marriage over, and I shall
be better able to see my way before me.
And I shall be rich, too, and able to reward
you for your kindness. The child
shall never be any burden to you, Lizzie.
You may depend upon me for that.’</p>

<p>‘And do you suppose I would take
your money?’ cried the other contemptuously.
‘Do you ask me to sell my
honour? You accuse me publicly of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the unmarried mother of this child,
and then offer to pay me for the disgrace.
You are only heaping insult upon insult,
Quita. You had better leave me before
you make me forget myself.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, Lizzie, I cannot leave you,’
exclaimed the unhappy girl, drawing nearer
to her, ‘until you have heard all I have
to say! You have always been my best
friend, Lizzie. As a little child I used to
run to you in every trouble, and trust you
to get me out of every scrape. You will
not do less for me now, Lizzie, will you?’</p>

<p>‘You ask too much, Maraquita. You
forget that in helping you out of this
danger, I involve myself, in the way
which good women dread above everything.
I have done it, but it is at the
expense of our friendship. I can never
be friends with you again.’</p>

<p>‘But you must—you <i>must</i>!’ cried Quita,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
falling on her knees, and hiding her face
in Lizzie’s lap, ‘for your father’s sake,
Lizzie, if not for mine.’</p>

<p>‘I have done it for my father’s sake,’
replied Lizzie, as she moved away from
Maraquita’s clasp. ‘Do you suppose I
have not been thinking of <i>him</i> all to-day,
and of the promise I made him? Nothing
else would have kept me silent;
but it is over now, and we need say no
more upon the subject. I beg of you,
Quita, to leave me, and go home again,
for your presence here is very painful to
me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lizzie, don’t be so hard! I am
not the unfeeling creature you take me
for. It is only fear of my parents that
makes me shrink from confessing the
truth. They would kill me, Lizzie, if
they knew it. They would not let me
live to disgrace them.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>‘Nonsense!’ exclaimed Lizzie. ‘They
would do nothing of the sort. They
would reproach you as they have me, and
you richly deserve it. But tell the truth
whilst you are about it, Maraquita. Say
that you have no feeling either for your
child or its father (whoever he may be),
and I may believe what you say.’</p>

<p>‘But you are wrong,’ interposed Quita
eagerly. ‘I love him dearly, and I should
have loved <i>it</i> also, if I had not been afraid.
And I can prove it to you, Lizzie, for I
have come here to-night to see the baby,
and I shall come as often as I can without
exciting suspicion. Where is she? Let
me see her at once.’</p>

<p>‘What baby?’ demanded Liz, with
affected ignorance.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Liz! how can you ask? Why,
my own baby, of course! The one you
have in charge.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>‘I thought you denied this morning that
you were a mother, Quita?’</p>

<p>‘I was obliged to do so. What could
I say, with mamma or papa liable to
come in at any moment? You might
as well have asked me to cut my own
throat. But here, alone with you, I can
say anything! I confess it is mine,
Lizzie, and that I knew all about it from
the beginning. I told your dear father
everything; and he promised that he and
you should stand my friends, and prevent
my secret from being published to the
world.’</p>

<p>‘I have heard all this before,’ said
Lizzie, still engaged upon her sewing.</p>

<p>‘And now you will let me see her,
won’t you? You will let me hold her in
my arms for a little while? I must not
stay long, for fear that meddlesome old
Jessica should come after me. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
will take me to my baby at once,
Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ replied the Doctor’s daughter
firmly.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean? Isn’t she here?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; but you will not see her.’</p>

<p>‘How dare you keep me from her?
She is mine, not yours.’</p>

<p>‘You did not say so this morning.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, but then I was mad!’</p>

<p>‘Are you prepared, then, to take your
child back to the White House with you?
Will you confess the lie of which you
have been guilty to your parents, and
exonerate me in their eyes of the charge
you have brought against me?’</p>

<p>Maraquita shrank backward.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Liz! that is too much. I should
destroy all my prospects at a blow by
such an admission. Besides, it has nothing
to do with the matter. All I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
is to see the child. Surely you will not
refuse so trifling a request?’</p>

<p>‘I do refuse it.’</p>

<p>‘But you have no right to do so.’</p>

<p>‘By your own account, Maraquita, I
have every right. You declared before
your mother that this child was mine.
Therefore I will keep it as such, and I
refuse to let you see her.’</p>

<p>‘And I am determined not to leave
the bungalow till I have done so!’ cried
Quita, rushing towards the bedroom door.</p>

<p>But Lizzie had reached it before she
did, and stood with her back against the
panels.</p>

<p>‘You shall not enter here,’ she said, in
a tone of authority.</p>

<p>Then Quita took to beseeching. She
fell on her knees again, and held Lizzie
tightly clasped about her feet.</p>

<p>‘Oh, my dear sister, let me see my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
baby, if only for a minute! I have been
thinking of her ever since this morning,
Lizzie,—of the dark eyes you spoke of,—the
tiny waxen hands and feet, and the
rosebud mouth; and I feel as if I should
die if I do not have her in my arms,
and kiss her, and tell her that I am her
mother.’</p>

<p>‘Will you tell the world so, Maraquita?’</p>

<p>‘You know that I cannot.’</p>

<p>‘Then you will not see your child
until you do,’ replied Lizzie, as she locked
the bedroom door, and put the key into
her pocket. ‘You have openly disgraced
me by palming on me the consequences
of your own sin. You have denied your
motherhood, and given up your most
sacred rights and duties. Well, for your
sake, and to conceal your shame, I accept
them; and the first act which I exercise
is to keep the child to myself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>‘You actually refuse?’ cried Quita,
starting to her feet, crimson with indignation.</p>

<p>‘Emphatically. There is only one way
you can secure the privilege, and that is
by an open confession of the truth.’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall never do it! And you
may carry the burden to your life’s end!’
exclaimed Maraquita furiously. ‘And another
with it, for you do not know all.
You have never asked me the name of
the father of this child! You came crying
to me this morning about Henri de
Courcelles, and how much you loved him,
and how anxious he was to discover the
parentage of my baby. He has lied to
you! He has made use of this dilemma
to get rid of you; for he knows whose
baby this is as well as I do. He knows
the mother and the father of it—for the
father is <i>himself</i>!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>She watched the light fade out of
Lizzie’s eyes as the cruel truth smote
upon her heart, and she grasped at the
back of a chair to save herself from falling.
But when the first shock was over,
she refused to believe the story.</p>

<p>‘<i>Henri!</i>’ she exclaimed, in a faint voice.
‘But it is <i>impossible</i>! Henri is—is—<i>mine</i>!’</p>

<p>‘He pretended to be!’ cried Quita
maliciously, ‘because it was a good blind
for them up at the White House, I
suppose, but he has been mine and
mine only for the last twelve months,
and he is nearly mad at the idea of
losing me now.’</p>

<p>‘And why must he lose you?’ said
Lizzie quickly, forgetting her own pain
in her lover’s wrongs. ‘If what you say
is true, why do you not marry him, and
take care of your little child between you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Maraquita shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Because my people will not hear of
such a marriage for me, and think I
should lower myself by becoming the
wife of an overseer.’</p>

<p>‘Not so much as you have lowered
yourself already, Quita.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not, but nobody knows that!
And then I am already engaged, so it
is of no use talking about anything else.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Henri,’ sighed Lizzie.</p>

<p>‘I can’t see why he is to be pitied!
He knew from the beginning that it
must all end some day. But I little
dreamt it would end like this. <i>I</i> am
the one who has suffered all the risk
and the blame, and yet no one seems
to pity <i>me</i>.’</p>

<p>Lizzie was silent. Her heart was
burning within her, and yet pride prevented
her speech. It was cruelly humiliating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
to find that all the time she had
been engaged to be married to De Courcelles,
he had been carrying on with
another girl, and had even had the audacity
to make his own fault the putative
cause for breaking off his engagement
to her. She could not decide at the
moment whether she loved or hated him
the most, his conduct appeared in so
mean and despicable a light.</p>

<p>‘You are right, Maraquita,’ she continued,
after a pause. ‘He is not worthy
of your pity or mine. He has cruelly
deceived us both—and you perhaps the
most, since even, if he loved you best,
he has served you worst! Even now—in
the first pitiless agony of hearing your
news—I can thank God I do not stand
in your position. And if you should ever
think better of your decision regarding
him, remember I shall not stand in your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
light, for from this day Henri de Courcelles
will be less than nothing to me.’</p>

<p>‘But the child!—you will not desert the
child?’ exclaimed Quita, with something
like maternal anxiety in her voice.</p>

<p>Liz shuddered.</p>

<p>‘It will be a double burthen to me now,’
she answered; ‘but I have already resolved
to do as my father would have
wished me, and I will not shirk my self-imposed
duty. I will do my utmost for
the child.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Lizzie, you are very good! You
make me feel so ashamed of myself,’ said
Quita, attempting to kiss her adopted
sister.</p>

<p>But Lizzie sprung aside from her.</p>

<p>‘Don’t touch me!’ she cried. ‘Don’t
stay near me any longer, or I shall be
unable to conceal the loathing I feel for
your conduct! False lover—false mother—false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
friend! Oh, Maraquita, Maraquita!
it would have been better if God
had called you to Himself when you were
as innocent as your unfortunate baby!
You and he, between you, have destroyed
all my faith in human nature.’</p>

<p>And Liz, throwing herself into a chair,
and laying down her head upon the table,
sobbed so bitterly and unrestrainedly,
that Quita, terrified at the sound, which
might attract spectators to spread abroad
the news of her being in the bungalow,
fled out into the darkness again, and made
her way back to the White House.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>R COURTNEY was quite as
proud as his wife of the
grand marriage his daughter
was about to make. He was inordinately
fond of Maraquita, and would have
considered her a fit match for a prince
of the blood royal. At the same time,
he was only a planter, and it was a great
thing to know that his child was going
to marry the highest man in the island.
He had plenty of money to bestow on
her—Sir Russell Johnstone had opened
his eyes when his future father-in-law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
had mentioned the dowry he would receive
with his bride—and when Maraquita
had obtained rank and position,
his best wishes for her would be gratified.
He was sitting in the room which
he called his office, and had just dismissed
Monsieur de Courcelles, when
his wife entered the apartment. Mr
Courtney had had occasion to find fault
with the overseer that morning. He
had not attended to several important
matters during the week, and seemed
sluggish and indifferent to his master’s
orders. Mr Courtney suspected that he
had been drinking also, and accused him
of the fact, and De Courcelles’ answers
had been too sullen to please him. He
was brooding over the change in the
young man’s behaviour, when Mrs
Courtney came panting into the room.
It was not often she honoured her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
with her presence during business
hours, and he saw at once that she had
some communication of importance to
make to him.</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear, what is it? Quita not
worse this morning, I hope?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, Mr Courtney! The dear
child grows stronger every hour, under
the knowledge of her delightful prospects,
and I am most anxious that nothing
should occur to mar her recovery,
for dear Sir Russell is naturally anxious
to have the wedding as soon as possible.’</p>

<p>‘Of course; but that is for you and
Quita to decide. You know that I shall
spare no money to expedite matters. The
sooner the dear girl is Lady Johnstone,
the better.’</p>

<p>‘So <i>I</i> say, Mr Courtney,’ replied his
wife, looking anxiously round. ‘But are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
you likely to be undisturbed for a few
minutes? Have you dismissed Monsieur
de Courcelles for the day?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, and not in the best of humours.
He is getting lazy, Nita, and I am not
sure that he is keeping as sober as he
should be. He gave me something very
like insolence this morning. Do you
know if anything is wrong with him?
Is his engagement with Lizzie Fellows
still going on?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Courtney, this is the very
subject on which I wished to see you.
De Courcelles has been behaving very
badly, in my estimation. You will hardly
believe, even when I tell you so, that he
has had the presumption to lift his eyes
to our Maraquita, and to swear he will
be revenged if she marries any other
man.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Impossible!</i>’ cried Mr Courtney, starting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
He had had his own suspicions respecting
the young overseer’s admiration
for his daughter and heiress, and, on a
former occasion, he had told him so, but
he had never had any idea that it had
come to an open avowal between them.
‘Do you mean to tell me,’ he continued,
‘that De Courcelles has had the audacity
to address Maraquita on this subject, and
to make her cognisant of his affection?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Courtney, where can your
eyes be? How blind you men are!
Why, he has been at the poor child’s
feet for twelve months past; and Quita
has kept him gently off, fearing to deprive
you of a valuable servant; but now
it has gone too far, and I feel it is time
I spoke.’</p>

<p>‘I thought he admired her, and told
him there was no hope for him, some
little time back; but he assured me I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
was mistaken. I offered, at the same
time, to forward his marriage with Lizzie
Fellows, but he declared that there was
no engagement between them.’</p>

<p>‘Then he has been deceiving you all
round, and is not worthy of your trust
and confidence. He <i>was</i> engaged to
Lizzie. She told Quita so yesterday, only
he broke it off on account of this disgraceful
affair at the bungalow. But all the
while he has been persecuting our poor girl
with his addresses, until she is positively
afraid of him, or what he may do.’</p>

<p>‘But what can he do? Surely he has
not dared to threaten her?’</p>

<p>‘He has said he will kill her at the
very altar, sooner than she shall marry Sir
Russell, or any other man, and has thrown
the poor child into such a state of distress
and perturbation, that I feel certain,
unless her mind can be set at complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
rest concerning him, it will greatly retard
her recovery.’</p>

<p>‘But it <i>must</i> be set at rest. This is
quite unbearable!’ exclaimed the planter,
striding up and down the room; ‘De
Courcelles must leave Beauregard at
once. I shall give him his dismissal this
afternoon.’</p>

<p>‘Not this afternoon, Mr Courtney.
Wait until we are safe on the hill range,
and then send him straight away. Maraquita
will have no peace until she hears
that he is gone.’</p>

<p>‘Fancy the presumption of his aspiring
to the hand of our daughter!’ continued
Mr Courtney indignantly. ‘A man without
a sixpence beyond his weekly stipend,
and no chance of increasing that. It is
the most barefaced impudence I ever
heard of. He shall get the sack before
he is a day older.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>‘But you will do it on some other pretence
I hope, Mr Courtney. You will not
bring in Quita’s name. I should be sorry
for it to get known that he dared to fall in
love with her. People are so ill-natured;
they might say she had given the fellow
some encouragement.’</p>

<p>‘They will not dare to say anything
against <i>Lady Russell</i>,’ said the father
triumphantly. ‘When do you start for
the hill range, my dear; and when is
the wedding to be?’</p>

<p>‘We go to-morrow morning. I have
ordered our palanquins for four o’clock,
and Joseph has arranged the coolie service
as far as the Government bungalow.
Quita wanted to ride up with Sir Russell,
but I am afraid of taxing her strength as
yet. As for the wedding, they have fixed
it between themselves for the fourteenth
of next month. Quita’s things cannot all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
be ready, but Sir Russell is willing to take
her as she is, until the trousseau is complete.
I never saw a man more in love in
my life. He is quite infatuated with
her.’</p>

<p>‘And well he may be, for there is not
a prettier nor sweeter girl on all the
islands. Well, my dear, De Courcelles
must go, there is no doubt of that, unless,
indeed, he will marry Lizzie Fellows.
<i>That</i> would put a stop to all unpleasantness
at once.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Marry Lizzie Fellows!</i>’ echoed Mrs
Courtney; ‘what, after he has been in love
with our Quita! Well, I should be very
much surprised if he could do that.’</p>

<p>‘But he was engaged to her (as you
say), or nearly so. Poor Fellows told me
as much himself. And it would be but
reasonable for De Courcelles to settle
down. He can’t have Maraquita, that’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
quite certain, and he might do worse than
fulfil his word to poor Lizzie.’</p>

<p>‘What, after she has disgraced herself?’</p>

<p>‘My dear, are you certain she <i>has</i> disgraced
herself? She assured me most
solemnly that child was not her own, and
had nothing to do with her, and I have
never known Lizzie tell a lie. It is as
incomprehensible to me as it is to you,
and I cannot understand my old friend
Fellows leaving the poor girl in such a
painful position. Still, you must not forget
that I have been just as true to him
as Lizzie evidently is to some other person;
and we should be the last people to
disbelieve her word, because she is unable
to give us any further explanation of it.’</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney had greatly fidgeted and
changed colour under her husband’s kindly
pleading.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Courtney, I really have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
patience with you! Do you honestly think
any woman would incur such a public disgrace,
without making an effort to clear
her character? I questioned Lizzie closely
myself only yesterday, and she refused to
open her lips, even to <i>me</i>, who have
known her from a baby. It is quite
incredible, and there is only one solution of
the mystery—that she pretends to possess
this stern sense of honour, in order to hide
her want of it.’</p>

<p>‘Is it possible that De Courcelles can
be the father of this child?’ said Mr
Courtney musingly, hitting the right nail
on the head without knowing it.</p>

<p>‘I daresay he is! I shouldn’t be surprised
at anything I might hear of
Monsieur de Courcelles.’</p>

<p>‘Well, my dear, I suppose he must go,’
returned her husband, with a sigh; ‘and I
will speak to him as soon as ever you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
have left the White House. I cannot
have Maraquita annoyed; and indeed if he
has behaved shabbily to poor Lizzie, it is
not right he should continue to live in her
sight. So you may consider that matter
settled.’</p>

<p>Upon which assurance Mrs Courtney
returned to her own room, to promise her
daughter that she should never again be
subjected to her cast-off lover’s appeals or
reproaches; and the following morning
De Courcelles watched their palanquins
leaving Beauregard, from the shelter of
the oleander thicket. A few hours after,
he walked as usual into the presence of
his employer. When the day’s business
had been disposed of, the overseer rose to
go, but Mr Courtney detained him.</p>

<p>‘Take a chair for a few minutes, De
Courcelles, I have something of importance
to say to you. You may remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
a brief conversation that took
place between us a few weeks back, on
the occasion of Miss Courtney’s illness.
I warned you that it would be wise to
keep your admiration of her within bounds,
and you assured me that you had done so.
My wife tells me a different story. She
says that Maraquita is both distressed and
annoyed by your evident predilection for
her, and I cannot have my daughter annoyed.
Therefore I think it is best that
we should part.’</p>

<p>Mr Courtney was an honest man by
nature, unused to <i>finesse</i> or intrigue of any
kind, and he had quite forgotten his wife’s
caution with respect to introducing Quita’s
name as a reason for the overseer’s dismissal.
He had gone straight at his
fences, and the leap was over. Henri
de Courcelles flushed dark crimson as the
subject was thus openly mentioned to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>‘I am quite unaware how I can have
annoyed Miss Courtney,’ he replied. ‘I
have not even seen her since her recovery.’</p>

<p>‘Is that the case?’ demanded the planter.
‘Then perhaps it was before. But anyway,
as she is so shortly to be married to
the Governor of San Diego, you must see
the propriety of discontinuing any false
hopes you may have entertained concerning
her.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Courtney’s engagement is, then,
a settled thing?’ said De Courcelles
bitterly.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, and the wedding-day is fixed
for the fourteenth of next month. My
daughter will soon rank as the highest
lady in the island, and any kindness which,
as a young and thoughtless girl, she may
have shown you (or any other friend) in
the past, must not form any pretension
for claiming to be on familiar terms with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
the Governor’s wife, or Sir Russell Johnstone
might resent it as an insult.’</p>

<p>‘I understand you perfectly, sir, and
Lady Johnstone need fear no recognition
of any claims I may have had upon Miss
Courtney, from me.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Claims!</i> I do not understand the
term, De Courcelles. What <i>claims</i> could
you possibly have upon my daughter?
You are forgetting yourself. Miss Courtney
can never have been anything to you
but a gracious young mistress and friend.’</p>

<p>‘That is how it may be, sir. Miss
Courtney knows her own secrets best,
and doubtless she has chosen wisely in
electing to become the wife of the Governor.
Rank and position cover a multitude
of sins.’</p>

<p>Mr Courtney did not like the style of
address adopted by his overseer, but he
scarcely knew how to resent it. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
half afraid to tell him to speak out. What
if Maraquita had really been light of conduct,
and employed her leisure time in
flirting with his overseer? It would be
a very embarrassing discovery, but not
an unnatural one, when De Courcelles’
extreme beauty and grace of form were
taken into consideration. So he thought
it prudent to change the topic.</p>

<p>‘Well, well,’ he said testily, ‘we are
not here to discuss Miss Courtney’s conduct,
but your own. You have not been
quite the same as usual lately, De Courcelles.
I have observed an unsteadiness,
and a disposition to sloth in you, which
has grieved me. Come now, let us
talk this matter over like two men of the
world. We will suppose you <i>have</i> had
a slight predilection for my daughter.
I am not surprised at it, and I do not
blame you; but you must have known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
it could never be anything more. Well,
in a few weeks she will be married, and
pass out of your life. What is the use
of spoiling the rest of it for her sake?
Why not settle down and make a home
for yourself? If you were married,
all this little unpleasantness would be
smoothed away.’</p>

<p>‘That is easy to say, Mr Courtney,
but not so easy to do.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t agree with you. There is a
nice girl close to your elbow, of whom
I spoke to you at the same time I
mentioned my daughter. I mean Lizzie
Fellows. Ah, you start! You have
heard this rumour about her, I suppose,
in common with others, and fancy it is
true. But I am sure it is not, De Courcelles.
I have known Lizzie from a child,
and I would stake my life upon her
honesty.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>‘You allude to the infant of which she
was left in charge, sir?’</p>

<p>‘I am glad to hear you mention it
like that. It proves you believe her
story. You told me there was no engagement
between you, but Mrs Courtney
informs me there was, and you broke it
off on account of this child. But women
jump at conclusions so: perhaps she is
mistaken.’</p>

<p>De Courcelles was quite capable of
defending himself.</p>

<p>‘Miss Fellows and I were <i>not</i> regularly
engaged at the time you spoke to me,
sir, nor have we been since. Only when
Lizzie refused to give me any explanation
concerning her nurse-child, I said
in my haste that want of confidence was
the death of friendship, and that we had
better not meet again.’</p>

<p>‘And you regret so hasty a decision?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>‘Why do you ask me, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Because if you and Lizzie like each
other, I should be pleased to see you
married. I am fond of the girl, and
consider her a sacred charge; and marriage
would silence these cruel slanders
against her, sooner than anything else.
If you can make up your minds on the
subject, De Courcelles, I will do for you
what I promised before—raise your salary,
furnish the Oleander Bungalow afresh,
and settle it on you and your wife, and
all these little disagreeables will be forgotten
before three months are over our
heads.’</p>

<p>‘And if not, sir?’ inquired the overseer
hastily.</p>

<p>‘If <i>not</i>, De Courcelles, we must part.
I am sorry to say it, but I shall consider
your refusal (or Lizzie’s) as a proof that
the less you are about the White House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
in the future the better. Not the
slightest taint—not even the bare suspicion
of one—must rest on the fair
name of the future Lady Johnstone.’</p>

<p>‘I understand you, Mr Courtney, and
I will consider your proposal. How soon
do you expect to get my answer?’</p>

<p>‘Not until you are quite prepared to
give it me. You have plenty of time before
you. My wife and daughter will be
away on the hills for a month, and I have
no wish to part with an old friend in such
a hurry. Think of it well, De Courcelles.
I will look over any of the little derelictions
of duty to which I have alluded, in consideration
of the disappointment which you
must have suffered; but my decision is final
with regard to Miss Fellows. You must
either marry her, or leave my service.’</p>

<p>De Courcelles left the planter’s presence
grinding his teeth with rage. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
burned, while listening to his talk about
his daughter’s marriage and future prospects,
to tell him to his face that Maraquita
was, to all intents and purposes, <i>his</i>
wife, and the mother of the child at the
bungalow. But he dared not! He was
afraid not only of the planter but of the
negro population, if such a story got wind
in the plantation. Revenge is sometimes
very swift and sure in the West Indies,
especially when the natives are in a state
of insubordination. Besides, he would
gain nothing by such an admission. It
would not give him back Maraquita—faithless,
perjured Maraquita, who, having
slipped from his grasp into the arms of
the Governor of San Diego, had instigated
her parents, by a tissue of falsehoods, to
dismiss him summarily from Beauregard.
And it would have robbed him of the hope
of revenge—a hope sweeter to a Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
Creole even than love. As Henri de
Courcelles thought of it, his hand tightened
over the stiletto he always carried in his
belt. Banishment from Beauregard would
mean to sit down for the remainder of his
life under this bitter wrong, without the
satisfaction of feeling he had avenged it.
At all hazards he must remain near this
false love of his. She should never feel
secure from him. He would appear before
her in her most triumphant moments, and
make her tremble with the fear that he
was about to accuse her openly of her
secret crime. Maraquita Courtney should
never know another peaceful moment,
whilst he lived to terrify her. But the
opportunity depended on his marrying
Lizzie Fellows. Well, if it must be so,
it must be so. Henri de Courcelles, strolling
down the path between the rows of
coffee trees, and caressing his handsome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
moustaches as he went, seemed to have no
doubt that he had but to ask to obtain.
The conceit of men, where women are
concerned, knows no bounds. Every
woman, according to their creed, is only
too ready to fly into their arms. The
good old days when knights were not considered
worthy to ask for a lady’s hand
until they had achieved some doughty
deed to make her proud of them, are gone
for ever. Yet, if a girl is particular, or
indifferent, or hard to please, she is voted
to be either a prude or a jilt. The rougher
sex require a few hard raps occasionally, to
keep them in order, and the woman who
puts them in their place, confers a benefit
on the whole of her kind. As Monsieur
de Courcelles strolled along, his footsteps
carried him in the direction of Lizzie’s
bungalow, and thinking no time like the
present, he halted on the threshold, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
called her by her name. The recollection
of how he had last left her presence made
him hesitate to walk boldly into it, but he
was quite confident that he had but to ask
her forgiveness to obtain it. Lizzie was
just about to visit her sick negroes. She
was dressed in a white gown, covered with
an apron and a high bib of brown holland,
and on her head she wore a broad-brimmed
hat, tied with a black ribbon. She looked
pale and weary, but the look of perplexity
was gone from her face, and her general
expression was calm. She was filling her
basket with such medicines as were necessary,
when she heard her name called in
the old familiar tones of De Courcelles.
As the sound struck on her ear, she turned
even whiter than before, but resentment
prevented her losing her presence of mind.</p>

<p>‘What do you want with me?’ she demanded
sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>‘Only a few words of explanation and
apology. May I come in, Lizzie? I
have been longing to do so ever since we
parted.’</p>

<p>‘You can enter if you wish it, monsieur,
but I cannot imagine what you can possibly
have to say to me. I have looked
upon our last meeting as a final one.’</p>

<p>‘But may you not change your opinion
of it, and of me?’ replied the overseer, as
he entered the room, and advanced to her
side. ‘I know I sinned against you grossly,
almost beyond forgiveness, but you must
make allowance for the whirlwind of passion
I was in,—for the awful doubt that
had assailed me.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot admit that as any excuse for
your conduct, monsieur. You had my
word that I was innocent, and you were
supposed to be my friend. There is no
friendship without trust and confidence.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>‘Do not say “<i>supposed</i>,” Lizzie. I
<i>was</i> your friend, as I am now, and ever
will be, if you will forgive my hasty words,
and reinstate me in my old position.’</p>

<p>‘That can never be,’ she rejoined
hastily. ‘You were <i>supposed</i> to be much
more than my friend, but you deceived
me all along.’</p>

<p>‘How can you speak so? How did I
deceive you, Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘I would rather not discuss the subject,
monsieur,’ said Lizzie, taking up her
basket. ‘This is my time for visiting
my patients, and they will be expecting
me. I must wish you good-morning.’</p>

<p>‘No, no; I cannot let you go until we
have arrived at some explanation!’ exclaimed
De Courcelles, detaining her by
the folds of her dress. ‘You accuse me
of deceiving you, and yet I thought my
fault lay in being too outspoken. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
I shouldn’t have said what I did. I
regret it deeply, from the bottom of
my heart, and I humbly ask your pardon
for the implied affront. Is not that
sufficient?’</p>

<p>‘It is more than sufficient,’ replied
Lizzie coolly, as she disengaged her gown
from his grasp, ‘and more than I wished
you to say. However, I accept your
apology, and we will say no more about
it. Now, will you please to let me go?’</p>

<p>‘No, you must stay! Put off your
visits till this afternoon, and hear me
out. I have not told you half my story.
Have you quite forgotten that we are
engaged to be married, Lizzie?’</p>

<p>‘I have not forgotten it, but I have
ceased to believe in it. You ruptured
our engagement of your own free will.’</p>

<p>‘But that was in my anger, and a few
angry words, Lizzie, are powerless to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
undo the tie which had existed for a
twelvemonth. I did not mean what I
said. I have regretted it ever since, and
I am here this morning to ask you to
forgive it, and let our engagement stand
as it did before.’</p>

<p>He was drawing closer to her, confident
in his powers of fascination, but she
pushed him from her.</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Courcelles, I am surprised
at you! I am surprised now to
think that I should ever have believed
in you, or thought the engagement you
entered into with me anything but a
blind for your more serious intentions in
another quarter.’</p>

<p>He started backward with astonishment,
little dreaming that she knew the
whole of Maraquita’s sad history.</p>

<p>‘I don’t understand you,’ he gasped.
‘I have never been engaged to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
woman but yourself. I don’t desire to
marry any other woman. I came here
to-day with the express purpose of asking
you to condone the past, and marry
me as soon as may be convenient to you.’</p>

<p>A few weeks before, how her heart
would have beat at such a proposal, how
her cheek would have flamed assent, and
her humid eyes have sought his with
grateful love. But now she sprang
aside as if he had insulted her, and
flashed defiance on him to repeat the
offence.</p>

<p>‘How <i>dare</i> you?’ she panted. ‘How
dare you speak to me of marriage—you,
who have treated me with scorn and
contumely?’</p>

<p>‘But I have acknowledged my error,
Lizzie. Surely you are not a woman
to resent a fault for ever. You <i>used</i> to
love me, I am sure of that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>‘Don’t be <i>too</i> sure,’ she interposed
hastily. ‘I loved <i>something</i>, I know,—some
creature conjured up by my imagination,
but not the man of flesh and
blood I see before me. For I did not
know you then, and no one can love an
unknown person.’</p>

<p>‘Lizzie, you are very hard upon me!
I am not perfect, any more than other
men, but I don’t know what I can have
done to merit such bitter taunts from
you. At all events, try and know me
now as the man who loves you, and entreats
you to marry him. Lizzie, be my
wife! Mr Courtney is aware of our attachment,
and has made a very generous
offer of assistance, if we marry each
other. If your affection for me was ever
true, you will not refuse me now.’</p>

<p>‘My affection for you <i>was</i> true,’ replied
Lizzie, looking him full in the face;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
‘and all the more does that make me
say I will never marry you now. <i>Never!</i>
Not if there was not another man in the
world.’</p>

<p>‘But <i>why</i>? Surely you will give me a
reason for your refusal, Lizzie.’</p>

<p>‘My reason is soon given, monsieur.
Maraquita—my earliest friend and my
adopted sister—was here last night. She
came to ask permission to see the child,
of whom both of you have accused me
of being the mother, and I refused her.
I told her since I had to bear the blame,
I would also maintain the authority over
it. And then—in a moment of passion,
I suppose—somewhat like that moment
which influenced you basely to get out
of your engagement to me by means of
a lie—she told me the name of the child’s
father. <i>Now</i>, do you wonder that I say
that henceforth there never can be any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
communion between you and me, except
of the most ordinary kind. The man who
could take advantage of his own sin to
ruin the character of an innocent woman,
will never make a good husband to any one,
and I have done with you for ever!’</p>

<p>Henri de Courcelles turned his face
away to the open window, the dark blood
mantling for very shame into his cheeks.</p>

<p>‘I have nothing to say for myself,’ he
muttered presently. ‘I am only a man,
and men are very open to temptations
such as these. But if I have sinned, I
have also suffered. I was led on by a
heartless woman, who has deserted her
child, and thrown me over for the first
suitor who presents himself with money
and position in his hands. I would
have married her willingly, but she
refused to marry me. She is an
infernal jilt, with as false a heart and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
tongue as ever woman had; and she has
been my ruin. She is nothing to me
now, and she never will be. If you took
compassion on me, Lizzie, and healed my
sore heart with your pure affection, you
should never have reason to complain of
even my thoughts straying that way. I
hate the very name of her.’</p>

<p>‘That is no palliation of your fault, in
my eyes, monsieur. I should feel for you
more if you told me her desertion had
made you miserable. But why do you
not appeal to Mr Courtney to stop this
unnatural marriage? Did he know the
truth, he would surely never allow his
daughter so to prostitute herself.’</p>

<p>‘What good should I effect by that,
Lizzie? Mr Courtney would only banish
me at once from Beauregard. Do you
suppose he would give up the prospect
of Maraquita becoming the Governor’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
wife, for the sake of an overseer? Besides,
he already suspects that I admire
her, and has told me as much, with the
adjoinder that the only condition on which
I can retain my situation is to fulfil my
engagement with you, and settle down at
the Oleander Bungalow as a married man.
In that case, he has promised to refurnish
the house, and raise my salary. So, you
see, we should be very comfortable; and,
if you wished it, you could retain your
medical appointment over the plantation.’</p>

<p>‘And so <i>I</i> am to be made the scapegoat
to bear your sins into the wilderness,
and to patch up your injured character at
Beauregard! You have mistaken me altogether.
I am capable, I think, of making
great sacrifices for a man who loves me,
but not for one who rightly belongs to
another woman. You will not retain your
position at Beauregard through <i>my</i> means.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>‘Then I am ruined,’ returned the overseer
fiercely, ‘and I owe my downfall to
you two women! You have destroyed
my life between you. I shall be turned
off the plantation, without a prospect of
employment. And if I become desperate,
it will be laid at your door.’</p>

<p>‘At Maraquita’s, if you please, monsieur,
but not at mine. I would have clung to
you through good and evil report, had
you been true to me. But I cannot forget
the cruel infamy you put upon me,
knowing it to be false. It is a crime past
a woman’s forgiveness,—a calumny that
will cling to me through life, even though
you married me in church to-morrow.
Yet I would rather go down to the grave
enduring it, than become your wife.’</p>

<p>‘It is finished then!’ exclaimed De
Courcelles, seizing his hat and rushing
from the apartment, ‘and I will trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
you no more on the subject, now or ever,’—and
the next moment he was striding
hurriedly towards his home.</p>

<p>Lizzie trembled as he left her, but she
did not weep. Her stock of tears was
exhausted. And had they not been, a
cry from the infant in the next room
would have dried them at their fount.
She summoned Rosa, who was basking
asleep in the verandah, to its assistance,
and with a deep, deep sigh for her dead
past, lifted her basket, and took her way
to the coolie quarters.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">J</span>ERUSHA, the East Indian
coolie, sat at the door of her
hut, nursing her baby on her
knee, and with a very sullen expression
on her countenance. Indeed, all the hands
on Beauregard had borne more or less
of a rebellious look of late. They had
no particular grudge against Mr Courtney,
who was a kind, if rather an indolent
master, delegating all his duties to his
overseer; but they detested Henri de
Courcelles, and the accounts of his cruelty,
and selfishness, and dishonesty, formed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
staple portion of their conversation. His
very beauty, and evident self-consciousness
of it, the vast superiority which he
assumed over them, and the rigour with
which he carried out the rules of the
plantation, all combined to set the coolies
against him, and they thirsted to find out
something which might degrade him from
his office. The reports from the Fort, too,
the constant attempts at rising which had
to be quelled, had incited them on to
imitation, and altogether the plantation
workers were seething under a sense of
wrong, and ripe for rebellion. Poor little
Jerusha, with her handsome half-caste
baby in her arms, might have furnished
them with a pretext for denouncing the
overseer, had not her case been too
common a one amongst them. But to
the girl it meant the devastation of her
life. She had not courted her destiny.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
She had been landed in San Diego, a
poor trembling Indian coolie amongst a
herd of fellow-sufferers, who had been persuaded
to leave Calcutta under a promise
of good wages, and plenty of food, and very
little work, and after a voyage of four
months (during which they had been
herded between decks like so many
swine), had been marched ashore at San
Diego, too weak and frightened and disappointed
to have any hope left in them,
unless it were that they might die. They
had been all standing together for hire,
when De Courcelles had sauntered by
and picked out the likely ones for Mr
Courtney’s plantation. Jerusha well remembered
how he came like a prince
amongst them, and how handsome he had
looked in his white linen suit and broad-brimmed
hat, with the blue silk handkerchief
knotted at his throat, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
crimson rose blooming in his button-hole,—and
when he had stopped beside her
and spoken to her in his low soft tone,
she had thought him more glorious still.
She had not sought him out, this poor
little Indian girl, but he had pertinaciously
come after her. He had asked for her
the very day after she had entered the
plantation, and put so many questions
as to whether her hut was comfortable,
and her food sufficient, that Jerusha was
quite bewildered. And then he had
given her new clothes, smart dresses—such
as the natives love to deck themselves
in—and gold earrings for her ears;
and the usual consequence followed. She
fell to the tempter’s seductive arts. It
was a sort of heaven to the poor untaught
coolie to be selected from all the
other girls to be the favourite of the
handsome young overseer. She never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
troubled her head to think how long
his preference would last. She knew that
he would never marry her—she would
have laughed at so ludicrous an idea—and
yet she fancied somehow that her
happiness would never end, and was
terribly disappointed and bitterly incensed
when the day came that De Courcelles
ordered her back to her quarters with the
other coolies, and refused to make any
difference between them. She had reproached
him with his conduct on the
occasion which has been related, but, if
anything, it had had the effect of making
him more severe with her, and Jerusha
realised at last that all was over between
them, and that she had been only a tool
and a plaything to minister to his short-lived
pleasure. She was pondering resentfully
on his neglect as she sat on
the ground, with both her hands clasped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
round her knees to make a cradle for
her little Henri, as she would persist in
calling the child, greatly to the annoyance
of the overseer. Henri was a
beautiful infant, large and round and
buoyant, with much more of the father
than the mother in his appearance. He
was gaily dressed in a short calico shirt
of red and white striped cotton, with
bangles on his fat brown arms, and a
string of blue beads round his neck,
and as Jerusha rocked him to and fro,
and heard him crow with delight at
the exercise, the gloom on her face
would suddenly disappear, and she would
seize the boy in her arms and kiss
him vehemently. As she was thus
amusing herself, a shadow fell between
her and the setting sun, and old Jessica
from the White House stood before
her. Jessica had been much put out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
by her young mistress leaving her
behind when she started for the hill
range. It was the first time such a
thing had occurred, and the old nurse
felt it accordingly. Had she not waited
on Missy Quita, hand and foot, ever
since she was a baby? and if she <i>had</i>
been sharp enough to discover her
secret, had she not kept it as faithfully
as Missy would have done herself? And
why should Missy Quita leave her
behind just as she had obtained her
wish and was on the road to make
the great marriage that Jessica had
always foretold for her? The faithful
old negress felt aggrieved; and when
sunset came, and Mr Courtney had
gone out for his evening drive, and
the White House seemed deserted, her
heart turned to her old friends in the
negro quarters, and she walked down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
have a chat with them, and unburden
herself of her troubles.</p>

<p>‘Eh, Jerusha, gal!’ she exclaimed, as
she caught sight of the young East
Indian, ‘and how’s de baby? He berry
fine boy, Jerusha. He make big strong
coolie, bime-by.’</p>

<p>‘Coolie,’ repeated Jerusha scornfully.
‘My little Henri never make coolie boy.
I tell you dat, Aunty Jess. Henri’s a
lord’s son, and he’ll be gennelman, bime-by.’</p>

<p>‘You go ways, Jerusha; you talking
nonsense! Lords is only for great ladies
like my Missy Quita.’</p>

<p>‘Missy Quita going to marry a lord?’
said Jerusha inquisitively, as Jessica
took a seat beside her.</p>

<p>‘Wall, he’s not quite a lord yet, but
I ’spect he will be bime-by. But he’s a
great rich gennelman, and the Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
of San Diego, and that’s next to being
a king—jes’ so! But I wish my missy
take me up to hills with her. I never
been lef’ behind before. I can’t tell why
my missy think to go widout me.’</p>

<p>‘Praps she want de lord all to herself—’</p>

<p>‘I not interferin’ wid her little games!
All her life I let her do jes’ as she like;
and she don’t mind ole Jessica! Ah, I
know more dan one secret ob my missy’s—you
bet, Jerusha!’</p>

<p>‘I dessay! All gals hab dere secrets,
and dere lovers too. Dis lord not Missy
Quita’s first lover, <i>I</i> know.’</p>

<p>‘Why, o’ course not—handsome young
lady like dat. But de good looks not
allays de good heart. Missy not grateful,
’pears to me,’ grumbled Jessica. ‘She
not want me any longer now she got
Sir Russell to wait on her.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>‘De good looks not allays de good
heart,’ echoed Jerusha; ‘you may well
say <i>dat</i>, Aunty Jess. De good looks
sometimes cover de debbil’s heart—like
Massa Courcelles’!’</p>

<p>‘Sakes! what you know ’bout <i>him</i>,
Jerusha?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know no <i>good</i> of him,
Aunty.’</p>

<p>‘Jes’ like all de rest ob de world. I
nebber could bear dat oberseer; he berry
bad fellow; and dis morning he ’sulted me
dreffully. Jes’ hear, Jerusha. I comin’
from White House, quiet as could be, wid
nothin’ to do, now my missy gone, when
I meet dat Courcelles walkin’ along and
swearin’ to himself. He came straight up
to me and he say, “Out ob my way, you
d—d old hag! If it hadn’t been for your
peepin’ and listenin’, I believe I should
have had my own way. Wait till I get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
you down to de cotton fields agen, and
I’ll serve you out for dis.”’</p>

<p>‘Laws, Aunty Jess, and what <i>you</i>
say?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> say “You jes’ stop dat, you bad
man. I knows all about you; and you’ll
nebber get me down to cotton fields
agen, for if you tries it, I’ll blow de
roof ob de Oleander Bungalow off your
head, and tell de ole master eberyting!”’</p>

<p>‘An’ what is der to tell?’ cried
Jerusha, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>‘Sakes, gal, more than <i>you</i> guess!
But I don’t see why I shouldn’t tell
you, now my missy safe, and goin’ to
marry de Governor. ’Sides, my missy
not behave berry grateful to me. ’Tis
de way wid de white folk. Why, Jerusha,
dat oberseer Missy Quita’s lover for
ober a year, and she go out night after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
night to meet him in de bungalow, as
I’m a livin’ woman—’</p>

<p>‘She—go—meet—Massa Courcelles?’
gasped Jerusha.</p>

<p>‘Sure! And more, dat baby down
at Doctor’s bungalow no more Miss
Lizzie’s child than it is yours. Dat
baby ’long to Missy Quita and Massa
Courcelles. <i>I</i> knows! but I never tell
till my missy so ungrateful as to leave
me behind, and dat man swear and
call me “d—d hag!” But you nebber
tell nobody else, Jerusha! You
keep dat secret like your life, till
de wedding’s ober—and then, what
matter?’</p>

<p>‘Dat baby is <i>his</i>? Oh, de false man!’
cried the coolie, with flashing eyes, as
she sprang to her feet, and held little
Henri at arm’s length. ‘And dis chile
ob mine, dis white-skinned boy, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
you think <i>he</i> ’long to, Aunty Jessica?
Why, to that villain too! Dat’s his
fader! Your fine Massa Courcelles,
what ruin your missy and me same
time!’</p>

<p>‘What you say, Jerusha? Your baby’s
fader de oberseer?’</p>

<p>‘Sure! Didn’t he favour me ober all
de other coolie girls on de plantation?
Didn’t he give me my earrings and
bangles and my Sunday shawl, and
tell me I de prettiest girl he ebber see?
And I fool enough to believe him,
Aunty; I thinkin’ he lub me allays,
and be good to me, for little Henri’s
sake. But when he found I should
hab a baby, he sent me back to de
fields, and I work dere till I nearly
drop. And he beat me—yes, Aunty!’
shrieked Jerusha in her rage, as she
turned her flaming eyes up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
skies; ‘he whipped me and my poor
baby, and laughed when I dared him
to strike us! And I vowed to hab
my revenge on him, and I will hab it
yet. Massa Courcelles shall live to
wish he nebber deceived a poor coolie
girl, or struck her baby! That’s so!’</p>

<p>‘And <i>I’ll</i> help you, Jerusha, for I hate
dat man, and I swore once to give him
obeah water for deceiving my poor
missy. And now he serve you de
same—dat’s twice bad; and I know
anudder heart what he’s broken, though
she as good and pure as de white May
lilies in de garden—and dat’s Miss
Lizzie.’</p>

<p>‘Nebber <i>Miss Lizzie</i>!’ cried Jerusha
incredulously. ‘Miss Lizzie do wicked
ting? Why, she’s de best woman I
ebber see!’</p>

<p>‘No, no, Jerusha! I not mean dat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
Only dis villain make lub to de poor
gal, and promise to marry her, and now
she breakin’ her heart because he so
false. Rosa tell me eberyting. She
pretend to be asleep in verandah dis
morning, and hear all they say. Miss
Lizzie ’clare she nebber, nebber marry
him now.’</p>

<p>‘She miserable woman if she do,’ said
Jerusha. ‘But hush, Aunty Jess, here
come Miss Lizzie. Don’t say nuffin
’bout little Henri ’fore her. She too
good and sweet! She not like us! I
never dare tell her who was his fader.’</p>

<p>As the coolie spoke, Lizzie came up to
them, pale but smiling. She carried her
basket as usual on her arm, and as soon
as she saw little Henri, she drew a small
sponge-cake from a selection of such
dainties which she carried for the sick,
and held it out to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>‘What a beauty he grows, Jerusha!
He will soon be out of arms now, and
toddling after you everywhere.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, Missy Liz, he bery fine boy,’
replied the young mother, in a subdued
tone.</p>

<p>‘Is anything the matter?’ said Lizzie,
quickly glancing from Jerusha to the old
nurse. ‘No bad news of Miss Maraquita,
I hope, Jessica?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, Missy Liz. Missy quite well
enough, I guess. ’Tis them she leave
behind what feel bad.’</p>

<p>‘You miss her, I daresay, and the White
House seems dull without her. Well,
you will soon be gay enough when the
wedding takes place.’</p>

<p>‘I s’pose so, Missy Liz. Is dat baby
at your bungalow all right, missy?’ continued
Jessica inquisitively.</p>

<p>Lizzie flushed to the roots of her hair.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
She had encountered some impertinence
on this subject before, and she feared
a repetition of it.</p>

<p>‘It is quite well, Jessica, although it
is very weakly, and I am not at all sure
of rearing it.’</p>

<p>‘A good ting if it die,’ said the nurse;
‘and if all such babies died, Missy Liz—we’ve
no room for them here.’</p>

<p>‘You shouldn’t say that, Jessica,’ returned
Lizzie mildly; ‘for it may be
God’s will that it should live.’</p>

<p>‘Better say good ting if its <i>fader</i> died!’
exclaimed Jerusha. ‘That’s the sort we’ve
no room for. Ah, Missy Liz, no use
you opening your eyes like dat. We
know plenty on dis plantation, we do!—and
we know de good from de bad too,
and may de Lord help us to root ’em out.’</p>

<p>‘Have you any special enemy here then,
Jerusha?’ demanded Lizzie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>‘Yes, I have,’ replied the coolie, with
dogged determination. ‘Massa Courcelles
is my special enemy, and I hate him!’</p>

<p>‘Monsieur de Courcelles, Jerusha? Has
he been unkind to you, or done you any
wrong?’</p>

<p>‘He has done me <i>dis</i> wrong!’ cried
Jerusha, holding out her baby. ‘He has
given me dis chile, and blows on the top
of it!’</p>

<p>She would have said more, but Lizzie
put her hand to her head, and, with a
low cry, passed swiftly from them. The
women gazed after her in astonishment.
They could not understand a nature without
any feeling of revenge in it,—with
only the deepest pain for the sins of one
it loved, and a horror of hearing them
mentioned by others. They thought
that Lizzie had misunderstood them, or
had not heard aright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>‘Dat’s funny!’ exclaimed Jerusha.
‘’Pears I didn’t put things right, or she
would have smacked little Henri on the
head, or killed him dead, as I’d like to
kill dat baby at de bungalow.’</p>

<p>‘Missy Liz not one of <i>our</i> sort,’ said
Jessica. ‘She allays berry quiet and
gentle, but I guess she <i>feel</i> same as
rest.’</p>

<p>‘Does she <i>know</i> about dat baby at de
bungalow?’</p>

<p>‘I ’spect she knows eberyting, and dat
dese low niggers say it is <i>her</i> chile: same
as Massa Courcelles did! Poor Miss
Lizzie, she’s too good for us. She
oughter run a knife into him and the
chile too.’</p>

<p>‘That’s so,’ cried Jerusha; ‘and dat’s
what <i>I</i> will do for her! I full of revenge,
Jessica. I like to get up some night and
fire de Oleander Bungalow, and burn dat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
man in his bed! I like to stick him wid
knife, same as pig—an’ to make him
drink poison water till he die.’</p>

<p>‘Better give him de obeah water—dat
safe and silent,’ replied the nurse;
‘but you must do it secret, Jerusha. You
mustn’t tell anybody but me.’</p>

<p>‘I telling no one; but I watch and
wait, and I hab my revenge. I swear it
on my little Henri’s head!’ said Jerusha
solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>EANWHILE Maraquita, up on
the hill range, was fast recovering
her equanimity. With
Lizzie and the Doctor’s bungalow out of
sight; with her mother’s assurance that
De Courcelles should be banished from
Beauregard before they returned to it;
with recuperated health, and the prospect
of a marriage beyond her most ambitious
dreams, life seemed to stretch out like
one long vista of pleasure before her.
Hers was a shallow, frivolous nature, incapable
of looking beyond the present, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
of dwelling long upon the past. She was
a terrible coward though, and had she remained
on the plantation, and been subjected
to the entreaties and reproaches of
her lover, might have thrown up everything
to link her fate with his, and regretted
it bitterly for ever afterwards.
The marriage she was about to make with
Sir Russell Johnstone was in reality far
better suited to her. So long as he was
attentive to her, and loaded her with
presents, she didn’t mind his being middle-aged
and ugly, for she had very little
sentiment in her nature, and no idea of
love as it should be betwixt man and
woman. Her notion of a lover was of
some one who must be always paying her
compliments, or giving her pretty things,
or devising schemes for her enjoyment,
and in these particulars Sir Russell was
perfect. He displayed all the infatuation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
and imbecility which usually attacks an
elderly man who finds himself in sudden
and unexpected possession of a beautiful
girl; and Maraquita could never inhale too
much of the incense of flattery. She
bridled, and simpered, and blushed under
his adoring glances, as if she had never
been subjected to such an ordeal before;
whilst Mrs Courtney would entreat ‘dear
Sir Russell to spare her little girl such
a battery of admiration, or he would
frighten her back into her shell.’ Quita
was beginning to give herself also all the
airs and graces of a Governor’s wife, and
to hold her head above even her own
mother. The Government Bungalow was
charmingly commodious, and filled with
official servants, whom the little lady
ordered about as if they already belonged
to her; and in fact she had already reconciled
herself so effectually to her new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
position, that she had almost forgotten that
which was just past, and which she was
ready to try and believe had never existed.
She rode with the Governor, and walked
with him, and smiled at his compliments,
and even suffered him to embrace her,
without the least display of repugnance
or dislike. Not that the recollection of
Henri de Courcelles had entirely ceased
to trouble her. She thought of him often,
but with no warmer feeling than fear.
She would start, every now and then, in
the midst of her occupation, to remember
the threat he had made her, and to shiver
under the apprehension that he might
fulfil it. She would run at such times to
her mother, and implore her to find out if
De Courcelles had really left their service,
and if he had quitted San Diego, or
was lingering round Beauregard. She
declared that she never could summon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
courage to be married until she knew that
there was no fear of her former lover way-laying
her on her way to church, as he had
sworn to do, and perhaps injuring or
frightening her into a betrayal of the secret
between them. Mrs Courtney became so
anxious at last that her daughter’s mind
should be set at rest, that she asked her
husband to join them on the hills for a few
days, thinking it would be safer to confer
with him on the subject by word of mouth,
than through a letter. Mr Courtney came
up as soon as his business would permit
him, and the first moment his wife had
him to herself, she broached the distasteful
subject.</p>

<p>‘What have you done about De Courcelles,
Mr Courtney? Have you given
him warning to leave us?’</p>

<p>‘I have, my dear, for I feel very dissatisfied
concerning him. I sent for him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
as soon as you had left home, as I told
you I should, and informed him that reports
had reached me concerning himself
and Maraquita that I could not pass over
without comment.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Courtney! I <i>begged</i> you not to
use our dear girl’s name.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I couldn’t tell him a lie, Nita,
and I really could invent no better excuse
for sending him away. So I thought
honesty would be, as usual, the best
policy.’</p>

<p>‘But what did he say to it?’ demanded
Mrs Courtney breathlessly. ‘Did he
deny the fact, or—or—tell any falsehoods
about it?’</p>

<p>‘Not that I am aware of. He neither
admitted nor denied the truth of my
statement, but I could see from his
manner that it had hit home. So I told
him he could stay on the plantation on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
one condition only, and that was that
he fulfilled his engagement with Lizzie
Fellows.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>wish</i> you hadn’t,’ replied his wife,
with a look of vexation. ‘I don’t want
him to stay, under any circumstances.
Things can never be the same again
between us after the avowal of his
impudent pretensions, and I can’t see
how the matter would be improved by
his marrying Lizzie Fellows. In fact,
Mr Courtney, I think you should also
try and provide for Lizzie elsewhere,
for Quita can hardly notice her when
she is Lady Johnstone, after what she
has done.’</p>

<p>‘Nita, I don’t believe she has done
anything she need be ashamed of. I
have full faith in Lizzie, as I have told
you before, and I will not insult her
by a suspicion of wrong. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
with regard to her marrying Henri de
Courcelles, you may set your mind at
rest, for she has refused him.’</p>

<p>‘Lizzie has <i>refused</i> to marry De Courcelles?’
exclaimed Mrs Courtney, with
amazement.</p>

<p>‘Have I not said so? De Courcelles
seemed quite ready to accede
to my proposal, and I gave him a week
to settle it in. Before a couple of days
were over our heads, however, he came
to tell me that it was of no use, and Miss
Fellows had refused to have anything
to do with him. I told him I couldn’t
go back from my word, and that (under
the circumstances) I refused to retain
him on the plantation as an unmarried
man, so I would pay him a quarter’s
salary, and he must clear out in a week.
But before I did so, I walked down
to Lizzie’s bungalow, and had a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
plain conversation with her on the
subject.’</p>

<p>Mrs Courtney’s complexion faded to a
dull yellow.</p>

<p>‘About the nurse-child? Does she still
deny that it is hers?’</p>

<p>‘Emphatically, and with such undeniable
sincerity, that I quite believe her. I
would stake my life that she has nothing
to do with that child except to take care
of it. She is a most injured woman, in
my opinion, and I urged her, for her own
sake as well as ours, to do as her father
(were he living) would command her, and
reveal the name of the mother of the
infant.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Mr Courtney, how <i>very</i> wrong of
you to try and make Lizzie break her
oath! Why, it would be <i>perjury</i>!’ cried
Mrs Courtney, virtuously indignant, and
trembling with anxiety, ‘and I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
rather think she had fallen, than commit
such a crime. Surely she was not so
weak as to be persuaded to do such a
thing?’</p>

<p>‘No; she is adamant, and her lips are
closed like a vice. She refuses to say
anything upon the subject, excepting to
reiterate her former assertion that the
child is not hers. And she told me the
reason she had rejected Monsieur de
Courcelles’ proposal is because he has
said the same thing of her as other people.’</p>

<p>‘Well, of course. What can she expect?’
said his wife, looking infinitely
relieved. ‘It is very hard on the poor
girl, but she is bound to keep her oath;
and people <i>will</i> talk. I have heard the
coolies speaking of it in the most confident
manner, as if they had not the
slightest doubt that she is the baby’s
mother.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>‘I’d like to hear a coolie talking of her
affairs in <i>my</i> presence!’ returned Mr
Courtney, clenching his fist. ‘He
wouldn’t talk again in a hurry. If I
can’t do anything else for the daughter
of my poor dead friend, I will protect
her. But there was something Lizzie
said that somewhat puzzled me, Nita.
In speaking of De Courcelles, she used
these terms,—“<i>He</i>, who of all others
should have died before he accused me
of a crime of which he <i>knew</i> I was guiltless.”
She emphasised the word “<i>knew</i>”
so deeply that it attracted my attention,
and I asked her <i>how</i> De Courcelles should
<i>know</i> of her innocence above other people.
But I could get nothing further out of
her. She blushed to her eyes, poor girl,
and was silent; but I was sure she felt
she had gone too far. What can De
Courcelles know for certain, Nita? Is it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
possible he can have anything to do
with this mysterious little stranger at the
bungalow?’</p>

<p>‘Dear me, Mr Courtney, how can <i>I</i>
answer the question?’ exclaimed his wife
pettishly. ‘I don’t see anything peculiar
in Lizzie’s words. She meant, doubtless,
that being her betrothed husband, he
should have had more faith in her virtue;
and so he should. But men judge women
by themselves, and so we seldom come off
scot-free. But are you going to get another
overseer? <i>That</i> is the most important
thing to me. I can’t think of
that De Courcelles’ presumption with any
patience.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes, my dear! it is all settled, and
he leaves us next week. I have already
engaged his successor—Mr Campbell, who
used to manage the Glendinning estates
before old Mr Houston died. He bears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
an excellent character, and, I trust,
may prove all we require. He is noted
for his kindness to his coolies; and I
am afraid De Courcelles has not raised
the character of Beauregard in that
respect.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, he is a wretch all round!’ cried
Mrs Courtney; ‘and I shall not breathe
freely till he is gone. I hope he will leave
the island altogether.’</p>

<p>‘That I cannot tell you, for I have
nothing to do with his movements after
he quits the plantation. I think he is
sure to do so, however, as he is not a
favourite in San Diego, and would find
it difficult to get another situation here.
But let us talk of something more pleasant,
Nita. How is our Maraquita getting
on with the Governor? Is it all plain
sailing?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Plain sailing?</i>’ echoed Mrs Courtney.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
‘What a term to apply to it. Why, they
positively <i>adore</i> each other, my dear, and
are never happy when apart. Sir Russell
is only <i>too</i> charming. He follows Quita
about everywhere, and waits on her like
a slave. He has given her the most
exquisite diamond pendant, and an Arab
horse that cost him two hundred pounds.
I am longing to see our darling installed
as the mistress of Government House.
Sir Russell means to go over to Trinidad
for the honeymoon. The Government
steamer will take them on board directly
after the wedding-breakfast; and they will
be absent for a month. The day after they
return to Government House, the marriage
will be celebrated by a splendid ball. He
is going to issue invitations to everybody
in the island—high and low. Isn’t it
noble of Sir Russell? But he says he
would ask the whole world, if he could,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
to witness his triumph in the possession of
so lovely a bride.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t wonder at his enthusiasm,’ exclaimed
the father, ‘for he has got the
loveliest girl in the British possessions!
But what about her fal-lals, my dear?
Can they be got ready in time?’</p>

<p>‘Only just enough to go on with, Mr
Courtney; but Sir Russell is as impatient
as a boy of twenty, and refuses to wait a
day over the month. I have sent my
orders to England, as you desired me;
but, of course, they can’t be here in time.
The wedding-dress I can luckily supply.
Perhaps you have forgotten the exquisite
dress of Honiton lace you gave me when
the dear child was born. I am having it
made up over white satin; and she could
wear nothing, Sir Russell says, more elegant
or appropriate. As the happy event
is taking place in the hot season, Maraquita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
can wear nothing but white muslin
and lace, which I shall have no trouble in
procuring for her; and by the time the
rainy season sets in, her dresses will have
arrived from England. Really, Mr Courtney,
it seems as if the fates smiled upon
her, for nothing could be more fortunate
than everything has turned out.’</p>

<p>The planter acquiesced in his wife’s
opinion, and the few days he spent on the
hills confirmed it as his own. No two
people could appear to be happier than
Quita and her <i>fiancé</i>. She suffered herself
to be loved, and caressed, and petted
to any extent; and Sir Russell was always
ready to gratify her. Her proud father
thought she looked lovelier than ever,
under the consciousness of her coming
honours, and went back to Beauregard
fully satisfied that she was the most fortunate
girl in the world. But as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
time passed on, and the moment drew
near when the mother and daughter
must also quit the hills, Quita’s agitation
became very apparent.</p>

<p>‘Mamma,’ she would say, in a horrified
whisper, clinging fast to her mother’s
hand, ‘are you quite, <i>quite</i> sure <i>he</i> has
left Beauregard?’</p>

<p>‘Quite sure, my dearest. Your father
sent him away a fortnight ago, and
Mr Campbell, the new overseer, is
living at the Oleander Bungalow in his
stead.’</p>

<p>‘But might he not be hiding somewhere
near? At Shanty Hill, or in the
Miners’ Gulch? There are public-houses
in both those places.’</p>

<p>‘Quita, my child, you must get over
this foolish fear. In the first place, your
father is quite convinced that De Courcelles
has left San Diego, as there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
vacant situation in the island for which
he could apply; and in the second, even
if he were in the neighbourhood he would
not dare to speak to you, far less to try
and injure you.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, mamma, you don’t know Henri!
You should have seen his eyes when he
said he would stab me at the altar. He
is terrible when he is in a rage. And I
feel convinced he will keep his word. He
will hang about Beauregard till my wedding-day,
and then he will hide in the
church and shoot me, and I shall die
in my wedding-dress, bespattered with
blood!’ replied Quita, relapsing into tears
at the awful picture she had conjured up
in her imagination.</p>

<p>‘Quita, you will make yourself ill if
you go on like this!’ said Mrs Courtney,
with grave solicitude. ‘You are really
too silly to be reasoned with. Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
you forget you are going to be the
Governor’s wife? You are not going
to marry a nobody, but a man high
in position and power, and no one
will dare to assail you either by word
or deed. The church in which you
are married will be lined with the
military; and if you are nervous,
Sir Russell will have a special guard
of honour to protect you. But don’t
let <i>him</i> guess at any of your nervous
fears, for Heaven’s sake, or he may
get curious to learn the cause of them.
Rely on me, Quita, that all will be
well.’</p>

<p>‘But there is another thing, mamma,’
said the girl, after a pause. ‘I am horribly
afraid that old Jessica knows too
much. One night when—when—I had
been at the bungalow, I found her awake
and watching for my return. And two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
or three times she has muttered hints
that I could not misunderstand.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Quita, Quita, what trouble you
have got yourself into. It seems as if
we should never surmount the difficulties
in our path. I shall know no peace until
you are Lady Johnstone.’</p>

<p>‘Nor I either, mamma! But can’t we
send Jessica away too? I don’t intend
to take her to Government House, and
you will have no use for her when I am
gone.’</p>

<p>‘My dear, I am afraid it would be
dangerous to dismiss her. She would
guess the reason, and these negroes are
very revengeful. They will serve you
to the death, so long as you make them
your friends; but once turn round on
them, and their malice knows no bounds.
Jessica has been with you since your
birth, and to send her adrift just as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
are going to be married, would be to set
her tongue going like a mill-wheel. No,
Quita, you must pursue a more politic
course! I think we made a mistake in
not bringing Jessica up to the hills with
us. Had I known what you tell me
now, I would not have consented to
her being left behind; but you must
take her some presents when we return,
and do all in your power to conciliate
her. Don’t encourage any familiarity,
nor appear to understand any hints she
may give you, but keep her in a good
temper, my dear child, until after the
fourteenth, whatever you do.’</p>

<p>Acting on her mother’s advice, Maraquita
took a gaily-coloured shawl and
a necklace of gilt beads to Jessica when
she returned to the White House, and
made the old nurse’s heart repent that
she had been led into repeating any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
scandal about her missy. But the departure
of the overseer was too important
an event to be passed over in
silence, and Maraquita was doomed to
hear a repetition of what was thought
concerning it in the coolie quarters.</p>

<p>‘Missy seen de new oberseer?’ Jessica
commenced, the first moment they
were left alone. ‘He berry fine man,—broader
den Massa Courcelles, and
plenty more colour in face; nice hair
too—same colour as de carrots—and a
soft voice, kinder like a woman’s.’</p>

<p>‘No, Jessica, I haven’t seen him yet;
but papa has asked him to dine with us
this evening.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, Missy won’t like him same as
Massa Courcelles, for sure,—but Massa
Campbell good man for all dat, and
Massa Courcelles berry bad man—all de
niggers dance when he go ’way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
Jerusha she throw mud after him, and
frighten his horse so he stand right up
on his two legs.’</p>

<p>‘Was he hurt?’ cried Quita suddenly.</p>

<p>However frivolous a woman may be,
she cannot quite lose all interest, at a
moment’s notice, in the man she has
loved.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, missy! Massa Courcelles
same like part of horse. He nebber
thrown; only, he swear and curse plenty
at Jerusha.’</p>

<p>‘Who <i>is</i> Jerusha?’ asked Quita, betrayed
by curiosity into forgetting her
studied reticence; ‘and why should she
throw dirt at Monsieur de Courcelles?’</p>

<p>‘Ah, missy not knowing. Jerusha only
a poor coolie, but all de niggers would
throw dirt at Massa Courcelles if they
dared. But he been berry bad man to
poor Jerusha—same as he been to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
my missy,’ added Jessica, in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>Maraquita turned deathly white.</p>

<p>‘How has he hurt Jerusha?’ she asked,
in spite of herself.</p>

<p>‘He’s left her with a baby, Missy
Quita—a nice baby, too, most as white
as himself, with his eyes and hair; but
Jerusha feel bad about it, ’cause he’s
treated her berry cruel, and whipt them
both with de cowhide.’</p>

<p>Maraquita turned her head aside, and
burst into tears. She would have given
worlds that the old nurse should not
have witnessed her emotion, but she
could not restrain it. How true it is
that the love of most women is founded
on vanity, and that even if they do not
want a man themselves, they cannot
bear that any one else should have him.
Besides, this degrading <i>liaison</i> with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
coolie girl had taken place at the very
time that Henri de Courcelles had been
swearing eternal love to herself. Quita
did indeed feel at that moment that she
had parted with a woman’s best possession
for nothing. She had never been
so terribly humiliated before. Jessica
was not slow to take advantage of her
young mistress’s weakness.</p>

<p>‘Don’t cry, missy,’ she said; ‘dat man
not worth one tear from my missy’s bright
eyes. He false and cruel, and got bad
heart. Missy forget all about dis trouble
when she marry de Governor. And
Missy Liz will keep de secret, nebber
fear, and old Jessica too. Nobody tell
nuffin, de Governor nebber know, and
den eberyting go right.’</p>

<p>But this allusion roused the instinctive
fear in Maraquita’s bosom. She forgot
her mother’s caution, and the folly of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
resenting the old nurse’s hints. She forgot
everything, except the awful fear of
exposure, and in her alarm she played
her worst card, and turned round upon
Jessica like a fury.</p>

<p>‘What do you mean by speaking to
me like that?’ she panted. ‘How <i>dare</i>
you pretend to think that I cried because
I was in trouble for any one but the poor
coolie girl? I know I am a fool to feel
such things. Any one is a fool who
wastes a tear on you coloured people,
for you are all false, and mischief-making,
and scandalous; but it is too bad that
you should speak as though I were crying
for myself. What trouble could I be
in? I have everything I want, and in
a few days I shall marry the Governor,
and none of you will dare to say a word
against me; and if you do, Sir Russell
will have you whipped, and put in prison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and you may lie and die there, for aught
I care.’</p>

<p>It was a foolish and childish rage in
which she indulged, but Quita was not
much raised above the coloured people
she professed to scorn, either in intellect
or education. Yet it was sufficient to
excite the desire for revenge in the
object of her wrath.</p>

<p>‘Missy have me whipped and put in
prison?’ she shrieked; ‘<i>me</i>—who hab
nursed her in my bosom, ever since
she was a tiny baby? Oh, no, Missy
Quita, you nebber mean dat! I will
tell Massa Courtney, and de Governor,
eberyting before dat. I tell dem all
I know. I clare de character of poor
Missy Liz, down at de Doctor’s bungalow,
and I tell <i>whose</i> child dat is what she
nurse day and night.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Jessica!’ cried Maraquita, frightened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
beyond expression, as she threw
herself on her knees before the
old negress, ‘don’t say that. I was
beside myself. I didn’t stop to weigh
my words. I know you are good and
faithful, and will be true to me, and
keep my terrible secret, for you wouldn’t
ruin your poor little missy who loves
you; would you, Jessica?’</p>

<p>But the old negress was not to be so
easily conciliated. She looked very surly,
even whilst Maraquita’s white arms were
wreathed about her withered neck.</p>

<p>‘Missy Quita, you berry ungrateful gal,’
she murmured presently. ‘How many
nights I sit up and watch and wait, while
you flirting wid dat overseer, fear your
moder or some one come and find you
out? Den when you taken bad, ole Jess
know your trouble all de time, and nebber
speak one word. But now you going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
to be grand rich lady, you want to
kick old Jessica out, and forget all
she done for you. But I won’t be
kicked out, Missy Quita. You must
take me to Government House, and
give me good wages, or I won’t keep
your secret any longer; and it isn’t
no good saying I’m ungrateful, missy,
’cause you were ungrateful first, and you
knows it.’</p>

<p>Maraquita saw the terrible mistake she
had made, when it was too late. Why
had she not remembered her mother’s
advice to conciliate the old negress
until the marriage was an accomplished
fact? <i>Then</i>, Mrs Courtney would have
devised some plan to keep her quiet.
But now there was but one course open
to her,—to promise to give Jessica everything
she demanded, however unreasonable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>‘Why, of course, Nursey,’ she answered,
with assumed playfulness. ‘Did you think
I was going to leave my old darkey
behind? What should I do without
you? You shall come to Government
House as soon as I am settled there,
and dress me in the mornings, as you
have always been used to do; and
perhaps some day you may nurse my
little children as you nursed me. Will
that content you, Jessica?’ she added,
with trembling lips that ill-concealed her
anxiety.</p>

<p>‘And missy will raise my wages?’
demanded the negress; ‘Governor’s lady
give better wages than planter’s daughter,
and I hab worked for eighteen
long years in your service, Missy
Quita.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, yes! You shall have any wages
you like, Jessica. I shall tell Sir Russell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
what a good servant you have been
to me, and he will be proud to reward
you. But perhaps you would rather
have a pension,’ said Quita wistfully,
‘or a lump sum of money, that will
enable you to go back to your own
country, and live there.’</p>

<p>‘No, missy; I rather live and die with
you. You seem like my own child to
me, and San Diego like my country. I
no want go way; and if missy good to
me, I keep her secrets always, and no
one shall hear ole Jess tell de truth
about her.’</p>

<p>Maraquita felt this was only a compromise,
but she had no alternative but
to accept it. There was a hard, stony
look in old Jessica’s eyes that alarmed
her, and made her doubt her promises
of fidelity. She was not slow to perceive,
either, the mercenary motive of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
her demand for higher wages, but she
could not afford to comment on it. She
had put herself in the power of another
woman—the most terrible bondage the
sex is ever subjected to—and she saw
no way to loosen her chains, except by
perfect acquiescence. But she loathed
the old negress, even while she forced
herself to caress her. The affection of
her whole life seemed to have faded
beneath the ordeal to which it had been
subjected. Jessica was no longer the
kind and faithful nurse who had tended
her from her infancy, and to whom she
had run in every dilemma, but a hard
and grasping creditor, who had possession
of that which might ruin her
life, and demanded her very blood in
ransom. However, there seemed no way
but one out of the scrape, and so Maraquita
promised to do all and everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
that the negress might require, and tried
to soothe her ruffled feelings with soft
words and caresses.</p>

<p>But she did not feel sure that she
had succeeded, even though Jessica paid
her some honied compliments in return,
and lay down in her bed that
night longing more than ever that
the wedding-day had come and
gone.</p>

<p>All went smoothly, however. No one
saw or heard anything further of Henri de
Courcelles, nor was Quita even annoyed
by the mention of his name. He seemed
to have totally disappeared from Beauregard,
and Mr Courtney fully believed
that he had left the island. The old
nurse made no further disagreeable
allusions to the past, and appeared to
be as devoted to her young mistress as
she had ever been, so that Maraquita<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
regained her lightness of heart, and
turned her attention entirely to the
brilliant prospects before her. The fourteenth
was close at hand, and the preparations
for the Governor’s wedding,
which was to take place in the Fort
church, were on a scale of magnificence
never before attempted in San Diego.
The church was to be embowered in
flowers; the military were to line the
road leading to it; half the gentry in the
island were to be engaged in singing a
choral service; and a splendid barouche,
drawn by four horses, and preceded by
a guard of honour, was to convey the
newly-married couple back to Beauregard.</p>

<p>Here, naturally, all were in a flutter.
Mrs Courtney, never a good housekeeper,
was nearly out of her mind over the
wedding-breakfast and the completion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Maraquita’s dress, and was thankful to
delegate the issuing of the invitations to
her husband and her daughter. Mr
Courtney made out the list of names,
whilst Maraquita wrote the invitations in
a very irregular hand on gold-edged
paper. Half-way down the list she
came upon the name of Miss Fellows.</p>

<p>‘<i>Lizzie?</i>’ she exclaimed, with rather
rashly expressed astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Of course! why not?’ returned her
father quickly.</p>

<p>‘Well, because, although <i>we</i> don’t
believe the reports about her, papa,
<i>other</i> people do, and some of the ladies
of San Diego might object to meet
her.’</p>

<p>Mr Courtney consigned the ladies of
San Diego to a warmer region, but
held to his determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>‘There shall be no festivity held in
my house to which Lizzie Fellows is
not invited,’ he answered sternly; ‘and
the fact that she is still welcomed here,
will be the best denial of these infamous
calumnies against her. I should
be ashamed of you, my daughter, if you
consented to her name being omitted
from our guests. The poor girl has
suffered enough from the death of her
father, and the rascality of that scoundrel
De Courcelles, to say nothing of these
cruel rumours, without our turning our
backs upon her.’</p>

<p>The mention of De Courcelles’ name
was enough to stop Maraquita’s tongue,
and she wrote the invitation without
further comment. Only, as both she
and her mother anticipated, Lizzie’s
reply was in the negative. She made
her recent loss the excuse for not joining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
in any gaiety; but Maraquita and
Mrs Courtney knew that after the insults
they had hurled at her, she would
never place her foot voluntarily again
within the walls of the White House.</p>
